Zhu Daojiang said with a mournful tone, his grief and sorrow surpassing what is typically experienced during the initial period of mourning. When asked about the cause, he initially kept silent. However, upon being questioned by close friends or relatives in private, he tearfully recounted the following:

"My beloved wife and I had shared half a lifetime together, and I had never noticed any significant wrongdoings on her part. But recently, I had a dream in which I found myself in the underworld. I saw hundreds of women there, chained with silver shackles and driven forward with bone whips, entering a large governmental office. Suddenly, I heard heart-wrenching cries and felt a tremor in my soul. One by one, they were brought out, their bodies covered in blood and bones exposed, crawling on their knees like herded sheep and pigs. Among them, there was one who waved her hand at me. It was none other than my late wife."[1p]
Startled, I asked, "What crime led you to this state?"

He replied, "I was caught constantly harboring two intentions. At first, I thought it was just the normal state of affairs within a family. But unexpectedly, the strict laws caught up with me, treating the act of deceiving one's father and ruler as equally deserving of punishment. Thus, I ended up in this miserable state."

Curious, I inquired, "What were these two intentions?"

He explained, "They were nothing more than favoring my own children within the circle of relatives, protecting the maidservants among the slaves, and harboring favoritism towards my mother's faction within the group of my own kin. All of these actions were done without your knowledge, my lord. Now, every new moon, I must endure thirty lashes of the iron rod. I have no idea when I will be able to escape from this torment. These accumulated burdens are the cause of my suffering."

Before I could speak further, he was dragged away by the ghostly guards.[2p]
"For many years, the couple has been deeply affectionate, so they built a temple to benefit others. The bond between them is the closest, surpassing any relationship that can be easily severed. The principles of mutual respect and harmony are deeply ingrained in their relationship, and it cannot be violated by anyone who is disrespectful. Their mutual understanding allows them to address the intricate and subtle issues within the family that men may not be aware of or know how to handle. If they were to disregard this mutual understanding and prioritize their own interests, their actions would become unpredictable and could lead to great harm, beyond what can be seen or heard. Various conflicts and destruction stem from such disregard, and when the stakes are high, their guilt cannot be taken lightly."[3p]
Those who place deep trust in someone, entrust them with great importance, and deceive them without their awareness, allowing them to do as they please. Even among friends, this is considered heartless and deserves divine condemnation. Since all people are originally one entity, if they violate their obligations, shouldn't their heartless crime be even more severe? In common trivial matters, severe punishment is necessary, as they cannot be considered insignificant. 

There is no deceit as cunning and crafty as in the capital. I once bought sixteen taels of smallhua ink, packed in a worn-out lacquer box, a truly antique item. Upon testing it, I found that it was just clay molded and stained black, with white frost on top, likely gathered from a damp place. Furthermore, during the local examination in the year of Dingmao, I bought a candle for my small dwelling, but it wouldn't burn.[4p]
It was made of clay and coated with mutton fat. There was also a man selling roasted ducks under the light of a lamp, whom my elder brother, Wanzhou, bought from. We consumed all the meat, preserved the whole bone structure, filled it with clay, covered it with paper, dyed it to resemble a perfectly roasted duck, and applied oil on the surface, leaving only the palms, head, and neck untouched. Additionally, the servant Zhao Ping bought leather boots for two thousand coins and was very pleased with them. One day, it suddenly rained heavily, and he wore the boots outside, only to return barefooted.[5p]
The cover is made of black lacquer, giving the Korean paper a wrinkled texture, while the bottom is pasted with cloth to prevent fraying. There are many other counterfeits like this, but they are still insignificant items. A scholar once saw a beautiful young woman living opposite his house and inquired about her. It turned out that her husband was away on a military assignment, and she was living with her mother-in-law in the capital city. After a few months, news came that the husband had passed away, and the entire family mourned and wept while pasting white paper on the door. They set up a ceremonial altar, recited scriptures, and received condolences from others.[6p]
After a while, she gradually sold her clothes and even discussed marriage due to the lack of food. She chose a man and married him. After several months, her original husband suddenly returned, only to find out that the news of his death was a false rumor. Filled with anger, the husband intended to sue the official. The mother and daughter pleaded in grief, so they packed up all their belongings and drove the chosen man out.[7p]
Half a year had passed when the selected official arrived at the Yushi Office in the patrol city and came across this woman's case. It turned out that the woman, who was originally pleased with the first return, conspired with others to take advantage of the selected official's wealth. Later, her husband truly returned but ended up in defeat. Liqiu's skills are becoming even more extraordinary, aren't they? Furthermore, in the West City, there is a residence consisting of around forty to fifty rooms, with a monthly rent of more than twenty gold coins. One person had been living there for over half a year and always paid the rent in advance without any further inquiry. One day, suddenly, he closed the door and left without informing the landlord.[8p]
When the master looked around, he saw only ruins and debris, without a single beam left standing. Only the houses on the front and back facing the street still remained. In front and behind the house, there were doors, and the residents set up a wood shop at the back door to sell building materials, secretly dismantling the beams, pillars, doors, and windows of the house and selling them. Each inhabited a lane, so people couldn't notice. The continuous roofs and connected eaves were moved without a trace, displaying an extraordinary skill. However, these actions, whether to obtain cheap value or convenience, were driven by greed, and the blame is not entirely on the people.[9p]
Master Qian Wenmin said, "When dealing with people from the capital, one must be cautious and defensive. If we can avoid falling into traps, we should consider ourselves fortunate. Even when presented with apparent benefits, we must be wary of hidden schemes and cunning individuals who are capable of all sorts of deceitful tricks. How can there be any true advantages for people like us?" Truly, these words are sincere.

Wang Qingshi recounted a story about a younger brother plotting to seize his elder brother's wealth. He secretly hired a lawyer and held a meeting in a private room, where they discussed their plans under the illumination of a flickering lamp. The lawyer meticulously devised traps and stratagems, leaving no stone unturned, employing even the tactics of instigating conflicts from within.[10p]
With the plan already set, the lawyer stroked his beard and said, "Although the elder brother is fierce like a tiger or leopard, it will still be difficult to escape the iron net. But how will you repay me?" The younger brother expressed his gratitude and said, "With our deep friendship, our bond is as close as flesh and blood. How could I forget your great kindness?" At that moment, the two of them were sitting facing each other, when suddenly, a person jumped out and began dancing in the room, with eyes blazing like torches and long, shaggy hair like a raincoat. Pointing at the lawyer, he said, "Sir, think carefully. This person regards you as close as family. Are you in danger?" Laughing and dancing, he leaped onto the roof and disappeared. Both men and the attending servant boy were startled and frightened. The household members, sensing something amiss, called out to check on them, but they had lost consciousness. It was midnight when the servant boy woke up first and recounted what he had heard and seen.[11p]
The two individuals were not able to move until dawn. The secret had already been leaked, and there were many rumors going around, so they decided to abandon their plan and stay indoors for several months. It is said that one of them had an intimate relationship with a courtesan and they loved each other deeply. However, when he wanted to free himself from his duties, she refused to comply. She promised to live in a separate residence with the same courtesy as a lawful wife, but she resisted even more strongly. He was puzzled and asked her why. She sighed and said, "You abandoned your marriage commitment and hid from me. Can this kind of person be trusted for a lifetime?" The words of this ghost seem to be somewhat similar to what was seen.[12p]
Madam Zhang, the younger sister of the ancestral grandmother and the aunt of the elder uncle. When she was on her deathbed, she said to her attendant, "I can't get up anymore. It is said that those who are about to die will see their deceased loved ones, and I can see them now." She then looked around the sickbed as if searching for something. With a sigh, she said, "I was mistaken."[13p]
Then he patted his pillow and said, "A great mistake indeed." He closed his eyes again, gnashed his teeth, and pinched his palms, leaving marks, saying, "Truly a great mistake!" Suspecting it to be delirium, I dared not ask. After a while, he called for his daughter-in-law and summoned her to his bedside, telling her, "I used to think that my husband's side of the family was distant while my mother's side was close. But those who come to guide me are all from my husband's side, with no one from my mother's side. I used to think that my daughter-in-law was distant while my daughter was close. Now my daughter is gone and my daughter-in-law is here. Are they not related by one fate, and those of different factions not to be involved? Reflecting on my usual attitude, did I not value lightly what should be cherished, and cherish lightly what should be valued? I have made a mistake once, do not make the same mistake again."[14p]
It is said that this aunt Zhang was known to be a virtuous woman. Many women are inclined to favoritism and remain oblivious to it until their death. However, she, being a wise person, was able to turn back and reflect upon herself.

Confucius once said, "There are five ways to offer advice, and I will follow their exhortations." This shows the depth of understanding the sage had towards human emotions. In this particular family, there was a woman who had no children of her own and harbored resentment towards her stepson. Furthermore, her nephew, who was her son-in-law, was involved in improper conduct and had formed strong private alliances. It seems that reasoning and admonishment may not work in such complicated situations.[15p]
There was an old wet nurse, over eighty years old. Upon hearing this, I crawled to visit her, bowed down, and burst into tears, saying, "I haven't eaten for three days." The woman asked, "Why don't you rely on your nephew?" She replied, "I had some savings before, and my nephew treated me like his own mother, but he deceived me until all my money was gone. Now, if I were a stranger, I couldn't even get a bowl of rice." She was asked again, "Why don't you rely on your daughter's husband?" She said, "The husband deceived me for money just like my nephew did. After my money was gone, he abandoned me just like my nephew did. Regardless, my daughter can't do anything about it."[16p]
Then he asked again, "If close relatives are indebted to each other, why not take it to court?" She replied, "I did take it to court. The officials argued that as I have already married into another clan, I am considered an outsider to my natal family. And since my daughter is already married, I am also an outsider to her. Adoption is considered an extraordinary circumstance, but not adopting is not considered a crime by the law. They cannot make a fair judgment." He asked again, "What will you do in the future?" She said, "My late husband used to serve under a certain official and had a son with me. He has grown up now. When I sued my nephew and son-in-law, the officials stated that since I have this son, they will punish me severely if I don't take care of his stepmother. They have already sent a notice to detain and summon me, but I don't know when they will come."[17p]
The woman appeared suddenly lost and confused. From then on, her actions gradually began to change. This group of relatives and allies, who were unable to argue due to their lips being parched and tongues worn out, had their thoughts turned around by the woman's words. Speaking from personal experience and offering words of advice, she committed no offense, but those who heard it would be sufficiently cautioned. It seems that she used this technique when dealing with Empress Dowager Zhao.[18p]
Volume 18, Chapter 4: Misunderstood Listening (Part 4)

At the southern part of the city of Cangzhou, there was a wealthy household that was raided by thieves. After breaking into the doors, the husband and wife of the house were both captured, and no one dared to intervene. There was a concubine residing in the eastern wing who changed her clothes and escaped to hide in the kitchen. She secretly whispered to the kitchen maid, saying, "The master is in the hands of the thieves and dares not fight back. Each of the thieves has someone on the rooftop to prevent any rescue. However, they cannot see below the eaves. You should open the back window and follow the eaves to secretly inform the other servants: 'Mount your horses and arm yourselves. Surround the area within a three to five-li radius in all directions. The thieves will surely come out after the fourth watch of the night. If they don't come out by then, they won't be able to return to their nest when morning comes.[19p]
If the enemy's main force is sent out, as long as no one stops them, they will travel one or two li before they release their hostage. If they don't release the hostage, it is feared that they may reveal their destination. Once they release the hostage, it is urgently necessary to carry them back. The others should then follow closely behind, ensuring that they are within half a li of each other. If they turn back and retreat, we should also stop; if they halt, we should halt as well; if they move, we should move with them. If they turn back and retreat for a second time, we should once again pursue them; if they stop again, we should also stop; if they move again, we should move with them. This cycle should be repeated four times. If they do not turn back and retreat after the fourth time, then by following them we will find their nest. If they turn back and retreat, we will be unable to engage them in battle or let them escape. By the time dawn breaks, not a single person will be able to escape.[20p]
"The maid risked her life to make a report. Everyone thought her reasoning was sound, so they indeed captured the culprits. She was heavily rewarded for her bravery. I had not been on good terms with the maid due to her previous indiscretions, but from then on, we got along well. Later, I asked her, 'How did you manage to accomplish this?' With tears in her eyes, she said, 'I once stole a certain person's daughter, and when her father was still alive, he mentioned that the only method to instill fear in criminals is this approach, but I had never seen it actually being used before.'"[21p]
"Currently, the situation is urgent, so let's try our luck to find a way out." It is said that those who employ military strategies must understand the situation of the enemy. Another saying goes, "Use thieves to attack thieves."

According to Dai Dongyuan, there was a fox living in an empty house, engaging in conversations with the homeowner, exchanging gifts and loaning objects to each other, living harmoniously as if they were neighbors. One day, the fox informed the homeowner, "There has been a hanging ghost in your second residence for many years."[22p]
Recently, there is a house nearby that no ghost would inhabit. However, one ghost has come to challenge me for the house. It frequently appears in terrifying forms, scaring the children. This ghost is already detestable on its own, but it also causes illnesses and fevers. It is unbearable. I have heard that a Taoist priest is skilled at expelling ghosts. You should seek their help to remove this harm."
The owner indeed sought and obtained a talisman, which was burnt in the courtyard. Suddenly, a violent gale arose, roaring like thunder.[23p]
Suddenly, there was a shocking disturbance, as the tiles on the roof of the house rattled and made loud noises, as if tens of people were running and trampling about. From the top of the house came a cry, saying, "My plan has failed miserably, and now I deeply regret it! Just now the gods descended to strike, and the spirits bound me while I was forced to leave you! Farewell, my friend!" It is known that one who cannot bear their frustration and seeks immediate satisfaction often ends up harming themselves as well. This case of a fox can serve as a cautionary example. Furthermore, my cousin from the Lv family (I have forgotten his name, but he is the eldest son of my aunt) told a story. There was a person plagued by fox spirits, so they hired a Taoist priest to perform exorcism and chants. The foxes disappeared but the priest continuously demanded more payment, sending people and creating disturbances using wooden puppets and paper tigers. By bribing the priest, the disturbances temporarily ceased.[24p]
After several tens of days, the haunting became even more severe than that of a fox. The family fled to the capital to avoid it and thus escaped. It is a clear sign that those who are eager for victory and rely on treacherous minions will inevitably face backlash. This is also a proof.

Hai Qiyun, a deputy general from Urumqi, once recounted an incident during the campaign against Wushi. After a battle, when he returned to the camp, he saw a person peering out from behind a juniper tree on a cliff. Suspecting him to be a spy, Hai fiercely stabbed at him with his spear (spear is called "miao zi" in the army, it means the sound it produces when swung). However, the spear struck the rock, causing sparks to fly and the spear to break. His arm was almost injured in the process.[25p]
Suspecting a dizziness in my eyes, I saw bloodstains on the ground and on the spear, yet I knew not what creature it was. I believed it must be a mountain spirit. In deep mountains and vast marshes, there is nothing that cannot be nurtured. The "Illustrated Records of the White Marshes," though exaggerated in many parts, likely contains some truth. Moreover, there is a story of a soldier who encountered a black creature crouching on a stone. Thinking it was a bear, he aimed and shot at it three times, all of which hit, but the creature remained unfazed as if unaware of the attacks.[26p]
Startled to the extreme, I hurried back and called my companions to bring their guns and go, but it had already left. I believe it was just a mountain spirit.

Liu Fu, an extra sedan chair bearer on the Changshan Road, said (there are eight sedan bearers in total, taking turns, and when leaving the capital, four more are added, known as extra bearers). The eldest sister, whose surname I forgot, was a girl from Shandong who was a refugee. She was around fifteen or sixteen years old and accompanied her parents to make a living in Chifeng (also known as Ulanhad). Ulanhad is translated as "red" and "peak" in Mongolian.[27p]
Today, Jian is now the city of Chifeng. He rented fields to cultivate. One day, he went into the mountains to gather firewood. Suddenly, he encountered strong winds and rain, so he took shelter under a rock. By the time the rain stopped, it was already dusk, and he was afraid to continue walking due to the presence of tigers. He hid amongst the grass. From a distance, he saw two torches, suspecting them to be the eyes of a tiger. As they approached, he realized they were several officials and their attendants, dressed in attire that seemed neither ancient nor modern. They sternly questioned him, asking who he was.[28p]
Confession is made. The official sat on a stone, ordering them to be pulled out while the crowd called for them to kneel. The eldest sister believed it was the mountain god, prostrating herself and listening to the command. The official said, "Your past sins should fill my stomach, now I will capture you and devour you. Quickly take off your clothes and lie on the stone, leaving no trace, to prevent any hindrance to my teeth."[29p]
The person said, "I am the Tiger King, please spare me." The official said, "Looking at your appearance, you are still acceptable. If you are willing to serve me in bed, I will pardon you. In the future, I will come and go to your house and bless you." The eldest sister angrily jumped up and said, "How could a god or spirit say such words? This must be an evil ghost! I will not tolerate such a thing. I, the eldest sister of a respectable family, cannot bear to do such an act while hiding my face." She picked up stones and fiercely attacked, causing everyone to scatter in all directions.[30p]
This is not achieved by one's physical strength, but by one's Qi (energy). One's strong and virtuous heart is enough to lead their Qi. Therefore, it is said: "When it comes to Qi, it is extremely great and firm."

Governor Zhang of Mugu once said that during the periods of Emperor De and Emperor Jing, there were wealthy households that constantly accumulated grains but not gold, in order to protect against robbery and theft. During the reigns of Emperor Kangxi and Emperor Yongzheng, there were frequent famines and the price of rice was high. They refused to open the granaries and release the stored grains, hoping for the price to rise even more.[31p]
The villagers were concerned about their fellow's illness but didn't know what to do. There was a prostitute named Jade-faced Fox who said, "This is easy, just prepare the money and wait for the opportunity." So she went to the sick person's home and said, "I am being pursued for debts by my old madam. Yesterday, I made a deal with a wealthy man named Bokui to redeem myself for a thousand gold. I'm also tired of the worldly affairs and longing for a trustworthy elder to spend the rest of my life with, someone like you."[32p]
If you can donate a thousand pieces of gold, then I will serve you as a handmaid all my life. I heard that you don't enjoy accumulating wealth, so even if you give me two thousand taels of silver, it would be enough to compensate. Yesterday, a timber merchant heard about this matter and has already gone back to Tianjin to gather the funds. It is estimated that it will take about half a month for him to return. I do not wish to accompany this mediocre servant. If you can make a decision within ten days, I would greatly appreciate your kindness." Zhang was deceived by this courtesan's words, and upon hearing this, he was surprised and delighted. He hurriedly sold his grain at a low price.[33p]
The granary has been opened, and buyers have flocked in. It cannot be closed again, so all the stored grain was emptied, causing a significant drop in rice prices. On the day when the grain was all gone, the courtesan sent a letter to apologize to the wealthy household, saying, "Madam Bao has nurtured me for a long time, and I spoke impulsively due to momentary resentment, resulting in such a proposal. Now I regret my actions and wish to stay. Principle cannot be betrayed. Let's postpone the matters discussed to a later date." The wealthy household had originally made a private agreement, without intermediaries or evidence, without paying any dowry, so they ended up with no solution.[34p]
This matter was also mentioned by Li Luyuan, so it must not be a falsehood. It is said that this courtesan was only sixteen or seventeen years old when she managed to accomplish this, truly a female hero. Ding Yaoyuan, on the other hand, said that there was a filial and talented scholar, forty years old without a child, who bought a concubine who was very clever and intelligent. However, the legitimate wife and the concubine could not get along and quarreled daily. After a year, they gave birth to a son.[35p]
Unable to tolerate the situation any longer, I decided to sell myself in a distant place. With a heavy heart, feeling lost, I found solace in my solitary study, unable to sleep at night. Suddenly, my mistress entered, lifting the curtain. Startled, I asked, "Why are you here?" She replied, "I ran away." Deep in thought, I, the loyal and honest scholar, said, "If you run away, they will surely chase after you. How can a jealous wife hide you? Moreover, now that things have come to this, where can we find refuge?" The mistress smiled and said, "I won't deceive you. I am actually a fox."[36p]
In the past, when a person came, they had human reasoning, and I dared not accuse or bear ill will towards them. But now, when a fox appears, it constantly changes and has no reason, coming and going without a trace. How can they know the truth about it?" Thus, she remained gentle and graceful as before. However, after a long time, she gradually confided in her maid. The legitimate wife, filled with anger, offered a large sum of money to hire a magician to investigate and punish her. The magician issued an order to capture the concubine, but she refused to accept the accusation. She resisted and argued with the magician, saying, "If the husband doesn't have a child with me, then it is justifiable to take in another wife. If he sends me away after giving birth to a child, then it is he who is being unfaithful. There is no reason to accuse me of wrongdoing and cast me out without cause."[37p]
The sorcerer said, "Since you have already revealed yourself, how can you return in secret?" I said, "I have not yet been married or estranged from you; I have not yet been married or estranged from my husband. Moreover, those who sold me were jealous wives, not husbands who saw me. If my husband takes me back, it means I have not truly left. Why can't I go back?" The sorcerer angrily said, "You are originally a beast, how dare you argue based on human reasoning?" I said, "When humans change into beasts, they are still subject to laws, both yin and yang. When beasts change into humans, it is considered a crime. By what code does the sorcerer justify his actions?" The sorcerer grew even angrier and said, "I possess the Five Thunder Method and can exterminate demons. I know nothing else!" I laughed heartily and said, "Demons are also creatures of heaven and earth. If they are innocent, heaven and earth will never cease to nurture them. If God does not punish them, should the sorcerer exterminate them all?" The sorcerer pounded the table and said, "Seducing men, is that not your crime?" I said, "I have accepted you with respect, and it is not considered seduction.[38p]
If one indulges in seduction and bewitchment, it will deplete their essence and inhale their breath, leading to a withered life. I have been at home for two years now, and I have returned for another five or six years. I am healthy and strong, so where is this so-called seduction and bewitchment? As for monks who receive envy from materialistic wives and engage in intense cultivation to cater to their greed, how could I ever submit to that?

During the conversation, the sorcerer looked around for the summoned deity, but it had already disappeared. Helpless, he glared and said, "I won't argue with you now. Tomorrow, I will summon the Thunder Department!" The next day, when the official tried to set up the altar again, the sorcerer had already fled during the night. It is said that although the method he held was righteous, he practiced it through bribery, so the enchanting spirits and deities were not afraid and the summoned deity was also dissatisfied.

It is rumored that when Mr. Liu Niantai was serving as the Chief Examiner, he wrote a couplet for the Imperial Historiography Office stating, "Teach your mind to be tranquil like water, and let your words be as sharp as frost."[39p]
"Truly, one can say that one knows the essence." Mö Xueya spoke, saying that there was a fellow villager who was suffering from the plague, lying on a grass pallet, when suddenly, their soul seemed to have left the house. They felt relieved from the heat and worries, experiencing a sense of comfort. However, the path they took was unfamiliar, and they walked aimlessly. By chance, they encountered an old friend, bringing both joy and sorrow upon seeing each other. Upon realizing that their friend had already passed away, they suddenly understood and asked, "Am I entering the realm of the dead?" The friend replied, "You have not yet died, it is only your soul that has temporarily arrived here."[40p]
"This place is inaccessible to ordinary people. Why don't we explore it together to broaden our knowledge?" With that, they continued their journey, passing through various towns and villages that were no different from the human world. There were bustling crowds and each had their own business to attend to. The villagers watched them pass by, but no one spoke a word. One of the locals said, "Have you heard of the Hell? Would you like to take a look?" The friend replied, "Hell is like a prison, only the underworld officials can open its gates, and only the underworld guards can guide you. I cannot go there. However, there are three peculiar ghosts near the vicinity of Hell, you can go and observe them." So they changed their course and followed a different path.[41p]
After walking for about half a mile, I arrived at a desolate place resembling a graveyard. There, I encountered a ghost who had the appearance of a human, except that it had no mouth beneath its nose. I asked, "Why is this so?" The ghost replied, "During its lifetime, this person was skilled in flattery and sweet-talking, always seeking to please others. As a result, they are now receiving this karmic retribution, rendering them speechless. When encountering flames or liquid, they have to drink it through their nose."

I also saw another ghost with its buttocks raised upwards, its head bent downwards, and its face against its belly. It supported itself with both hands as it moved. I inquired, "Why is this so?" The ghost answered, "During its lifetime, this person was arrogantly self-important. As a consequence, they are now receiving this karmic retribution, unable to lift their head proudly and look down on others."[42p]
I saw another ghost, from the chest to the abdomen, there was a crack of several inches long, and the internal organs were completely empty. I asked, "Why is this?" The ghost replied, "When this person was alive, they had a deep hidden nature that others couldn't perceive. So now, they receive this retribution, where their inner emptiness cannot be concealed."

I saw another ghost with feet two feet long, fingers as thick as beams, heels as large as cauldrons, as heavy as a thousand-hundred boats. It exerted great effort for half a moment, only moving an inch. I asked, "Why is this?" The ghost replied, "When this person was alive, they had exceptional talent and agility, always excelling in everything. So now, they receive this retribution, where they cannot move freely."

I saw another ghost with ears dragging on the ground, resembling wings but without any apertures.[43p]
Question: "Why is this so?" He replied: "This person, during their lifetime, harbored suspicions and was easily influenced by gossip. Therefore, they are now experiencing the consequences and are unable to listen. These are all results of their accumulated negative karma. Once the designated period of retribution is over, they will enter the cycle of reincarnation. Their punishment is reduced to a level equivalent to those who committed minor crimes and are sentenced to exile. Just like exiles under the Yang Li laws." Suddenly, a group of officials on horseback appeared, and among them, one underworld official passed by. Upon seeing the local resident, he exclaimed, "This is a living soul who has accidentally wandered here. I fear they may be lost and unable to return. If anyone knows their family, please guide them back."[44p]
Upon receiving the request, the official immediately ordered his return. As they were about to reach the gate, the person woke up from his deep sleep, realizing that he had fully recovered from his illness. Xue Ya Tian had a cheerful and open-minded nature, with no attachments in his heart. He often engaged in playful banter with his friends, and his quick wit and eloquence were always on display. It is possible that this story is a metaphor and may not be true. However, just like Zhuangzi's "Zhuangzi" and Liezi, they are also partly fables that contain meaningful lessons. So there is no need to insist on an obsolete method when the desired result has already been achieved.[45p]
Chen Banjiang said, there was a scholar who, on a moonlit evening, encountered a charming and beautiful woman. They exchanged subtle words and eagerly grew close. She claimed to live nearby but refused to disclose her name. She also revealed that her husband frequently went out for several days at a time, and there was a back window and a hole in the wall they could use to meet whenever possible, without predetermined dates. This clandestine affair lasted for five or six years, and their love deepened.[46p]
At the age of one, the scholar is about to embark on a long journey, and his wife comes to bid him farewell at night. The scholar says, "I will go along with fate, and we may not meet again for a long time." With a sorrowful expression, he chokes up and cannot speak. Suddenly, the wife playfully laughs and says, "If you are so sentimental, you will surely fall ill from longing. It was not my intention to be with you from the beginning. I must tell you the truth; I am a ghost waiting for a replacement."[47p]
When ordinary people fraternize with spirits, they all fall ill and eventually die, as yin overcomes yang. Only because of my love for you, my dear, I cannot bear to see precious jade shattered and delicate orchids ruined. Therefore, I will wait for you to recover your vitality for about seven to eight days before I am willing to come again. By experiencing loss and restoration, you will remain unharmed. If you encounter other spirits, indulge in their charms without reservation, and within half a year, you will be seeking me at the fish market. Amongst people like us, those who seek the same are scarce. Therefore, my dear, you should be cautious.[48p]
Feeling grateful for your righteous cause, this is my way of repayment." After speaking these words, the ghost let loose his disheveled hair, stuck out his tongue, and transformed into a ghostly figure. He let out a long howl and departed. The scholar trembled in fear, almost losing his soul. From then on, even if he encountered someone with a captivating appearance, he would never glance sideways again.

In Wang Mei's preface, it is mentioned that in the Jiaohe region, there were false accusations made against a villager, leading to a desire for justice. The sincere villagers sought to clear their name but had no means to do so. They resorted to bribing the local officials for help. When the officials heard about the false accusations, they took the opportunity to have illicit relations with the villager's wife, assuming she must be beautiful due to the attention given. They hinted subtly to the villager, saying, "This matter is secret. It is necessary for your wife to come discreetly in person before I can provide a plan."[49p]
The person in the living room reported to the villagers. The villagers were terrified and lost hope, so they called for the women in the village and secretly whispered to them about the situation. The women then told their daughters, but they responded with silence. After two or three days, someone from the government officials' family knocked on the door at night. When they opened the door, they saw a beggar woman with a cloth wrapped around her head, wearing a tattered shirt and entering abruptly.[50p]
When asked, she remained silent, simply walking and loosening her clothing and scarf. Yet her elegant attire and dazzling beauty revealed her status as a beautiful woman. Surprised and inquiring about her origins, her blushing cheeks gave no response as she lowered her head in silence, only to reveal a piece of paper from her sleeve. Upon examining it under the light of the lamp she held, the three characters "Someone's Wife" were written. The official's joy exceeded his expectations, leading her into an inner chamber to inquire about her intentions. With tears concealed, the woman said, "If I didn't understand your words, why would I have come here tonight? Now that I am here, there is no need to ask anymore. I only hope you will keep your promise."[51p]
After the official made a solemn oath, he then acquiesced to her gentle and graceful manner. He secretly stayed for several days and was greatly bewitched by the woman, causing his mind to become confused and anxious, fearing that he would not please her. The woman temporarily bid him farewell, claiming that she faced daily humiliation in the village and it was difficult for her to stay there for long. If she could find shelter near the city and be spared from being taken advantage of by scoundrels, they could also meet each other frequently. The official felt even more pleased and did everything he could to plead her case of injustice. After he was released from prison, he encountered villagers who showed little interest in him.[52p]
He thought he was getting familiar with his wife, but was embarrassed to see her again. Later, due to a matter in the hometown, he went to her house but she refused to see him. Knowing that she cut off contact with him, he was greatly saddened. Coincidentally, there was a case in which a person was accused of enticing a courtesan to gamble and it was brought to the authorities. The authorities ruled that the courtesan should be returned to her original place of registration. When the officials looked at her, they realized that she was a local woman from the village.[53p]
Please speak. The woman expressed her grievance over the prohibition imposed by her husband, feeling ashamed and burdened by it. She remembered their past deeply and was fortunate to meet again, so she begged for the remembrance of their previous joyful days and to avoid punishment. However, the official was confused again. He reported to the higher authorities, saying, "The prostitute is actually a woman registered in her mother's household, and she is the wife of a certain villager. Her husband should be investigated." It was a case of a corrupt official using his position to benefit himself by purchasing her.[54p]
The officials detained the villagers and summoned them to bring their wives. However, they separated one person from the rest. When asked, the villagers all claimed they were innocent. When asked the officials why they unjustly accused the villagers, they couldn't provide an answer and merely said they heard rumors. When asked who spread the rumors, they remained speechless. A prostitute was called upon and she revealed the truth, saying that the officials intended to take advantage of the villagers' wives. Realizing that the wives would refuse and risk their husbands' lives, the officials bribed the prostitute to impersonate one of the wives. They became acquainted through this scheme. Now, when the punishment was about to be administered, they coincidentally encountered each other, and the officials deceitfully implicated the villager's wife in hopes of avoiding punishment. However, their plan backfired as they had not expected any other schemes, causing both sides to suffer defeat.[55p]
"The official's investigation of the villagers turned out to be false accusations. Considering their plan to save lives, as well as the involvement of the official's wife, the matter was not further pursued. However, this official was severely punished. This wicked and cunning official is truly unparalleled in corruption, yet he was ensnared by a village woman, like playing with a child. Foolishness often leads to the downfall of the wise, and when things reach their extreme, they will reverse. It is often the case that unexpected wisdom emerges and triumphs beyond expectations. Everything will eventually come full circle; it is the way of Heaven."[56p]
If the wise never fail, then only the wise will survive in the world, while the foolish will perish. This is a profound principle! Ghosts haunt humans until death, their intentions unknown. Ni Yujiang said, "I have heard that Shi Liang is alive, actually feeding on the souls of the living. Ghosts are remnants of vital energy, gradually declining and dissipating until they no longer exist. By obtaining the vital energy of living souls, they can replenish themselves and prolong their existence. That is why female ghosts often seek intimacy with humans, in order to capture their essence. Male ghosts, unable to capture human essence, resort to killing people and absorbing their life force. Both are akin to a fox gathering and replenishing its energy."[57p]
As I recall Liu Ting's account, during the Kangxi era in the year of Gengzi, there were five scholars who sought refuge in a dilapidated temple due to a sudden rainstorm. Four of them had already fallen asleep, but one person was still restless, feeling a cold and eerie breeze. Suddenly, several dark figures entered through the window and blew their breath towards the four sleeping individuals, causing them to be plagued by nightmares. Then, they blew their breath towards the remaining person, whose mind gradually became hazy and confused. The person felt as if they were being dragged away. Upon partially waking up, they found themselves in a different place, seemingly bound and unable to make a sound when trying to call out. Looking around, they saw the four others lying sprawled on the ground, and the ghosts collectively carried away one person and consumed them in an instant. Then they proceeded to devour the other two in succession.[58p]
As the fourth person arrived, suddenly an old man entered from outside and sternly rebuked, saying, "Wild ghosts, do not act recklessly! These two individuals have a bond, it is not to be violated." The group of ghosts panicked and dispersed, and the two individuals abruptly awakened, recounting the same thing they had seen. One eventually became a teacher, while the other became an educator. When Master Bao Jingt­ing heard about this, he laughed and said, "I have always held a low position in life, but I did not expect to be highly regarded by spirits and ghosts." Upon examining his words, it seems that Liang Sheng's account may not be unfounded.[59p]
Li Qingzi said, "Zhu Shengli established a garden, and in the year Xinyou, he went north to take the imperial examination in Shuntian. In the evening, he passed by the north of Yangliu and, to avoid the muddy road, took a detour and lost his way. There was no inn nearby to stay. From a distance, he saw a house outside the woods, so he decided to go there for shelter. Upon arrival, he found a house with earthen walls and tiled roof, consisting of about six or seven rooms, and a young boy came out to answer the door. Zhu Shengli explained that he was seeking lodging for the night. An elderly man dressed in simple and elegant attire invited him in and accommodated him in a neighboring room."[60p]
The lamp was summoned, but it emitted a dim and feeble light. The elderly man said, "This year's scarcity of oil has made it quite dreary, but there is nothing we can do about it." He added, "It is late at night and we cannot prepare elaborate dishes, so let's have a small drink of village wine; don't consider it trivial." The atmosphere was very cordial and harmonious. Zhu asked, "Who is in your household?" The man replied, "We are alone and destitute, with only my old wife and a few young servants living with us."[61p]
When asked why he decided to go north, Zhu replied, "I have a letter and a few items that I wish to send to the capital. The remote roads make it difficult to find a courier, so I am fortunate to have encountered you." Zhu then asked, "Living alone in a place with no neighbors, aren't you afraid?" The person replied, "I have a small plot of land where I have a few slaves to help with farming. I settled here out of convenience. Being poor and having no savings, I am not afraid of thieves." Zhu said, "It is said that the wilderness is filled with ghosts and spirits."[62p]
The old man said, "If you have not seen any ghosts or apparitions, why are you afraid? If you are still worried, I can accompany you until dawn. Would that be alright?" He then borrowed red paper and a brush, and began to write a letter. He put various objects inside a sealed envelope, wrapped it tightly with an old cloth, and sewed it shut. He handed it to Zhu, saying, "The address is written on the envelope. When you arrive in the capital, open it and you will know what to do." They bid farewell at dawn, and the old man earnestly reminded Zhu not to lose the letter and objects. Zhu arrived in the capital and opened the wrapped cloth, revealing a letter with the words "Written by Mr. Zhu Liyuan" on it. Inside were a pair of golden hairpins and a pair of silver earrings. The letter explained, "As an old man with no offspring, I was deceived by my wife's words and took you as my son-in-law."[63p]
When visiting my great-grandson's grave, there is still a sense of connection; but in the future, we will be regarded as different clans. The paper money and wheat cakes have long been discontinued; the three-foot lonely grave is also in ruins. In the depths of the earth, the deceased feels pain, and I deeply regret many things that cannot be undone. I offer these meager items as a sacrifice to the coffin, praying for your wealth in the afterlife. On my way back, I will use the proceeds to repair the neglected cemetery and slightly deepen the water channel to the south of the tomb, so that the flood will not overflow the lonely graves.[64p]
"If you agree to my request, it will be as solid as the roots of a grass intertwined with dew. Knowing that you fear ghosts, I will humbly keep myself hidden in the dark and not dare to be seen, so as not to trigger any doubts or concerns. The deceased Yang Ning bows his head in apology."

Zhu was startled and his back drenched with sweat, finally realizing that he had encountered a ghost. He understood from the words written in the letter about the return journey that it was certain not to be successful, and indeed it turned out that way. Upon returning to Yang Liu, he used the money from selling his hairpin and other accessories to send someone to take care of his grave, but he himself did not dare to go there again.[65p]
Wu Yunyan said that there was a man named Qin Sheng who was not afraid of ghosts. He always felt sorry for himself for not having encountered one. One evening, while taking a walk in a separate property, he heard a clear and mournful chanting of a Tang poem from outside the trees: "People come and go without knowing, only facing the empty mountain and moon when returning." The voice was both mournful and long. Peering through the leaves, he saw a man in ancient attire and headgear, leaning against a stone. He was certain that it was a ghost and hurriedly stepped forward to cover it.[66p]
The ghost does not evade either. Qin Shengzhang made a deep bow and said, "Our paths differ between the mortal world and the realm of spirits, and people have changed greatly over time. It is an unexpected encounter, with no warmth or coldness between us. The reason for my visit is simply to inquire about the state of the spirits. May I dare to ask, what is it like to be a ghost?"

The ghost replied, "Once the physical body is shed, one becomes a ghost. It is similar to a cocoon transforming into a butterfly, but the ghost itself is unaware of it."[67p]
Question: "When the soul ascends and the spirit descends, does it return to the great void?"

Answer: "As a ghost, I exist right here. Now my whole body appears before you, never having followed the swirling primordial qi, ascending and descending. It is only during the ancestral sacrifices that the descendants gather as one, and after the ancestral sacrifices are finished, they disperse."

Question: "Are there truly gods?"

Answer: "Since ghosts are not unreal, gods themselves are not illusory. It is like how there must be officials to govern the people."[68p]
Question: "The early Confucians referred to gods like the thunder god, claiming that they are constantly born and transformed. Is this not a falsehood?"

Answer: "During my arrogant youth, I often heard such claims. However, I have doubts about the thunder striking and booming, as if there were countless thunder gods. If the thunder stops, does it mean the gods cease to exist? Would the lifespan of the gods be as short as that of a mayfly? With all due respect, sir, I have had my fair share of scolding. Only after becoming acquainted with the realm of spirits did I come to understand that countless gods faithfully carry out their duties. Just like the officials in the world, they are not ephemeral illusions. I regret not being able to provide you with firsthand experience. However, Mr. Yue's possession by Gao Bi has been ongoing for some time, and he should be aware of it himself, thus there is no need for further interrogation."[69p]
Generally speaking, the idea of the existence of ghosts has never been endorsed by sages. The fear of scholars being slandered has led to the forced creation of such beliefs. However, it is acceptable to prohibit excessive indulgence, but it is not acceptable to completely eliminate alcohol and fine spirits; it is acceptable to prohibit licentiousness, but it is not acceptable to abolish marriage; it is acceptable to prohibit greed and avarice, but it is not acceptable to eliminate wealth; it is acceptable to prohibit fighting and contention, but it is not acceptable to abolish the military. Therefore, despite gaining immense fame in a generation and garnering support from countless followers, one might silence others from speaking out, but ultimately cannot truly satisfy their hearts. This is the nature of such a situation.

Those who transmit these teachings, even though they know in their hearts that it is not entirely true, they cannot uphold such arguments. Thus, they cannot be considered scholars of profound knowledge. Contrary to their personal beliefs, they have to conform and say, "The principles must be like this." Your Majesty, please understand that the earlier Confucian scholars were correcting injustices out of a sense of urgency, which was not in line with their true intentions. The later Confucian scholars were countering erroneous theories under pressure and fear, which was also contrary to their true intentions.[70p]
To actually believe that Confucians truly claim that there are no spirits or gods? If you earnestly ask such a question, then you have long been deceived. Just as those who reside beneath the springs do not wish to have extensive contact with the living, it is also not appropriate for you to closely associate with ghosts for too long. This explanation is sufficient for now, and the rest can be inferred accordingly."

With a resounding voice, Man retreated with a long whistle. It can be seen from this that the Confucians clearly understand the existence of spirits, hence their denial. Similarly, the two ghosts in Huangshan claimed that the Confucians clearly understand that the system of private land ownership cannot be implemented, yet they say it can be implemented. Both cases reveal a profound understanding of the underlying issues. Only those with narrow vision would be like a falling into a fog that stretches for five li, unable to see the way out.[71p]
Wang Zhushi, a prominent figure, spoke earnestly and eloquently about the divination practices at West Lake. At the altar, someone recited a poem which goes, "Grasses grow densely where incense was previously buried, only the moon in the night at Xiling knows. Many lyricists come to mourn the past, with hearts torn apart they read inscriptions on poems. Through countless cycles of change, the lake remains green, clouds and rain in a thousand years, dreams still in doubt. Who believes in the flower-scattering maiden of Ling Shan? Nowadays, it is the Buddha's fire against the lustrous glass." Everyone recognizes this as the work of Su Xiaoxiao.[72p]
A guest asked, "Xian Ji was born in Southern Qi, how is she able to write Qilu poetry?" The diviner replied, "Having experienced the passing of years, understanding the principles of yin and yang, her innate spirituality remains clear. Thus, she is able to engage with the changing world. The wise Emperor Xuan knew the seal script, but how would he have written auspicious words in official script? Shakyamuni Buddha didn't understand the Chinese language, but how would he have written Buddhist texts in parallel prose? This indicates that the understanding of past scholars transcends time, and they are capable of comprehending current language and literature. Jiang Wentong and Xie Xuexi (Note: Xie Xuexi is likely a mistake for Xie Xi Yi.) were able to compose the eight-rhyme Qilu essay "Exchanging Horses for Beloved Concubines" (as seen in the "Collected Anecdotal Records"). Shen Xiuwenzi Qingxiang was able to write a five-word Qilu poem "Reminiscing about Jinling" with historical references. This demonstrates that ancient events are not doubtful in the present. Furthermore, can she write in the Yongming style?" He then wrote the following four poems: "Joy comes but cannot stay, I depart but cannot leave. Annoyed by the stony path, overnight it cuts off people's crossing."[73p]
"Where does the joy come from? Today's heavy rain and wind. My apricot shirt is soaked, all because of you, my love."

"Putting an end to my butterfly skirt, I row the sampan for joy. Gracefully gliding along the riverbank, the green waves reflect our shadows."

"Do not moor at the lotus pond, instead, moor at the willow shore."[74p]
"There are people walking outside the flowers, but I cannot see anyone in the deep willows." This is from the "Midnight Song." Although it may be the talent of a ghost, it can also be considered as eloquence. My cousin An Yi mentioned that during the autumn harvest in Hecheng, there was a young woman carrying a child walking on the embankment. Suddenly, she lost her footing and fell to the ground, never getting up again. The person who witnessed this from a distance suspected that something was wrong and hurried over to take a closer look, only to find that she was already dead.[75p]
The son also suffered a fractured skull and died after hitting a tile corner. The terrified owner of the field reported the incident, and the owner investigated the deceased. It was discovered that there was no such woman within several tens of li (a unit of distance), and moreover, she was elegantly dressed, unlike someone from a poor family. This caused great confusion and bewilderment. Additionally, the body was covered with a reed mat and closely guarded, but the news quickly reached the authorities. The city by the river was close to the county, and the officials arrived the next afternoon. When they lifted the mat for inspection, they found only a bundle of dried stalks in the middle, and the two corpses were nowhere to be seen.[76p]
The brick that was used to press the gold foil had not moved, and the guards had not left even for a moment. The official became furious and arrested the landowner and the guards. He interrogated them from various angles, but there was no trace of conspiracy, murder, or abandoned bodies. The case became entangled and complicated for over a year before it was brought to the authorities. The authorities were confused by the perplexing nature of the case, and they kept questioning and refuting each other. Another year passed before they decided to temporarily suspend the investigation, only to find that the family in question had already disappeared.[77p]
This is an incident that occurred during the Kangxi year of Gui Si and Jia Wu. It is said that in the graveyard south of the village, there was a black fox that would worship the moon every night, and many people saw it. There was a young boy from a certain family who was skilled in hunting. He secretly went there and lay in wait, aiming his crossbow at its thigh. Suddenly, there was a loud roar and a burst of fire, and the fox vanished into the west. When they searched its den, they found two small foxes, which they captured and took back home, but they soon managed to escape.[78p]
A month passed, and such an incident occurred. There were suspicions of a fox spirit manifesting itself to seek justice. However, the strange and uncanny nature of the matter made people reluctant to provide any evidence. The officials were also hesitant to open a case file. As a result, they had no choice but to secretly discuss the concealment of the body. Thus, the confusion escalated to this extent. It is also said that in a village to the west of the city, there was a beggar woman who was mistreated by her stepmother and was found hanged in a local earth god shrine.[79p]
I also carefully examined the corpse and kept a close watch on it. However, when I reached a higher position, both the corpse and the guardian disappeared without a trace. The investigation seemed to be as difficult as protecting a city by a river. It took another seven or eight years before I found them in Anping (a county in Shenzhou). The woman had fair skin, and while a young man was taking turns guarding the corpse, he stripped down and violated it. Miraculously, the corpse regained its spirit and the two of them fled together.[80p]
This is a story from the end of the Kangxi era. It is unclear whether it relates to the incident in Hecheng, as it is yet to be known. If they are indeed related, then the rumors are false. In the same year, Gong Xiaofu said that there was a man in his forties who had no children. His wife was fierce and jealous, refusing to accept the idea of taking a concubine. He was constantly melancholy and unwell. By chance, he came across a Taoist temple, where a Taoist priest approached him and said, "Your qi and complexion are stagnant, as if burdened by a heavy worry.[81p]
The Daoists always focus on benefiting all beings. Why not speak the truth and see if it can really be achieved? Could it perhaps be as effective as a lead knife? Curious about these words, I relayed the conversation in detail. The Taoist replied, "I have indeed heard of this. Let me ask you a question. If you were to make ten sets of ghost attire, would you be able to fulfill the request? If not, then it can also be entrusted to the official troupe." My astonishment grew, but I suspected that there must be a reason behind this deception. I decided to test what he could do. That night, my wife had a nightmare. She called out in her sleep, unable to awaken, and her moans and cries were extremely distressing.[82p]
The next day, both parties were silent and gloomy. When asked, they kept their secrets and only sighed. Three days later, the same situation repeated. And it continued to happen every three days. After half a month, suddenly one of them sent a servant to call the matchmaker, saying, "I want to buy a concubine."[83p]
No one believed it. Even her husband was concerned about the consequences and had many doubts. But after his wife fell unconscious for several days and woke up, she urged him to quickly buy concubines, placed money on the table, and made an agreement with the servants: if within three days the concubines were not satisfactory, they would be severely beaten. Observing her demeanor, it seemed that she was not speaking deceptively, so they went to find two women to fulfill her request and kept them. That evening, they prepared the bedding and urged her husband to enter the bedroom.[84p]
The entire family was shocked and bewildered, unable to fathom its meaning. It felt as if they were in a daze, lost in a dreamlike state. Later, they encountered a Daoist priest who revealed his ability to capture souls. At night, he would disguise the Daoist congregation as ghosts while he, adorned in a star crown and feathered robes, sat in the hall burning talismans to capture the soul of the wife. He explained that her ancestors, being unfilial, had been punished in the netherworld, and he presented a written plea to the underworld, using a peach wood staff to settle the matter. The wife's soul was then sent back with a deadline to take a concubine. At first, the wife believed it to be a terrible dream and refused. However, after three days of successive capture, she reluctantly agreed. As her mind grew hazy over the following days, her soul was suspended upside down and vinegar was poured into her nose. She was promised that if she did not find a suitable maiden within three days, she would be turned to clay.[85p]
The technique of soul possession is not inherently righteous, as righteousness and evil are absent in techniques themselves. They are simply tools used by people, much like a spear that can be used for both killing and conquering. The magnitude of the technique depends on how it is used, much like a medicinal herb that can either heal or cause great harm. It is the skillful use of the technique that is commendable, as demonstrated by Taoist priests who are able to control even the most unruly and stubborn individuals. They can subdue those who cannot be persuaded by reason or restrained by laws. Just as Yao led a sheep by pulling, and Shun drove it forward with a whip, if one shepherd can control it, the entire flock will follow. Each entity has its own vulnerabilities, and each medicine has its own fears.[86p]
The establishment of Shendao (the Way of the Divine) and the teaching of it aim to subdue the obstinate nature of the world and reflect the profound intentions of the sage. How can the pedagogues understand it?

According to Chu Hetin's account, there was a student from the Imperial College who was wealthy with great wealth. His first wife gave birth to a son who died. He remarried with a woman who was attractive in appearance, which caused confusion in the Imperial College. He claimed that his family affairs lacked proper management and thus invited his mother to come and help. His mother also brought along his two sisters.[87p]
After some time, his older brother and two younger brothers also brought their families. Over time, the household staff, including servants and maidservants, all became part of their wives' clan. The father and son from the academy, on the other hand, seemed miserable as if they were relying on others for sustenance. As time went on, they were not informed about the management of finances, records, and the flow of money and grains. Even the leftover food and cold dishes were despised and rejected. Unable to bear this any longer, they wanted to regain their authority, but their wife's brothers created chaos outside while the wife, mother, and sisters scolded them inside. They even experienced being beaten by a crowd, leading to disheveled hair and a beaten face, with no one coming to their rescue when they called for help.[88p]
His son rushed over and slapped the servant to the ground, only to then kneel and beg for a slow death. Filled with anger and overwhelmed, he headed towards a garden to end his life. Suddenly, an old man stopped him and said, "Don't do it, sir. The divine beings and spirits have long been angered by the affairs of your family. I have resided in your household for a long time, and the injustice is especially severe."[89p]
The lord burned a letter to the local earth god and begged for the expulsion of the foxes from his garden, promising that the god would grant his request. As the saying goes, that very night, the roof tiles clattered, doors and windows shook violently, and the members of his wife's family were all struck by bricks and stones, causing them to bleed from head injuries. Soon after, the women of his wife's family, including his own mother, were seduced by the foxes. During the day, they would go mad and run naked, uttering obscene words and behaving shamelessly. At night, dozens of foxes would gather in every room, tormenting and entertaining themselves in turn.[90p]
Unable to bear the devastation, the sounds of pleas and cries were heard everywhere. Even the dishes and delicacies in the kitchen were served before the father and son, both residing in the Grand Academy. The food consumed by the wife's relatives and their party was all mixed with impurities. Knowing that they could not stay, they all fled and returned to their homes. Only gradually did the Grand Academy manage to gather its former servants and restore domestic order, allowing it to sustain itself. However, the wife's relatives still harbored greedy desires and constantly came to visit and probe.[91p]
When one is a beginner, they are often struck down, either by their own personal belongings or by what they carry with them. By the time they return home, their bag is already empty. The same may be said for their wife, who secretly supplies them. Because of this, they disappear without a trace. However, when calculating the losses and damages to property, even the slightest help would prevent the father and son of the academy from starving to death. This is a matter that cannot be resolved by close relatives and intimate friends; only a sly fox could come up with countless strategies and plans. How could it be said that the fox is truly inferior to humans? Humans in the world are deeply entangled in its affairs, thus they distance themselves from suspicion, fear, and resentment. They seek simple solutions and avoid danger, watching but not offering help. The fox, on the other hand, is not well-versed in the ways of the world, so it does not possess the skills to cleverly and tactfully win the trust of wise and elderly individuals. Nevertheless, it will rise up vigorously and fulfill its rightful obligations and virtues.[92p]
Although he is a fox, I hold the whip for him, and that's what he admires.

There is a blind man named Liu Junrui who is over thirty years old and often travels by the Wei River. Whenever he meets someone who anchors their boat, he always asks, "Is this where Yin Tong is?" He then adds, "Yin of the Xia Dynasty, Tong of the Wutong tree." Those who share the same lodging with him often mumble these two words in their dreams. When asked about his name, it changes every ten days, and nobody deeply investigates further.[93p]
After more than ten years had passed, many people recognized him. Often when they wanted to inquire about him, they would call out, saying, "This is not Yin Tong, another person must be sought." One day, when the grain boat docked by the riverbank, a blind man asked as before. A person stepped ashore and exclaimed, "Is it you? Yin Tong is here. How could you do such a thing?" The blind man roared like a ferocious tiger, pounced on him, and bit his nose, leaving the ground covered in blood. The crowd tried to separate them, but they were tightly entangled, unable to be pulled apart.[94p]
Surprisingly, we both fell into the river and drifted away, disappearing completely. Later, the body was found in front of the Heavenly Concubine Palace (no body is found in the sea mouth, and searching for bodies in the river is fruitless, but they always surface in front of the Heavenly Concubine Palace). The palm leaf beat against his left rib until it broke completely, but he never let go. Ten fingers dug into his shoulders and back, penetrating more than an inch. Both cheeks and jaws were nibbled almost to the bone. Until the end, we had no idea what grudge he held, suspecting that it must have been due to the injustice suffered by his parents.[95p]
For a person without eyes to observe someone with eyes, they will not be able to judge. And for a weak and feeble person to confront a strong and aggressive person, they will also be defeated. Compared to the enmity between Wu Xu and Chu, the revenge becomes even more difficult. Yet for more than ten years, he remained determined and eventually succeeded in devouring his enemy's flesh. This demonstrates the utmost sincerity and even heaven and earth cannot go against it. Song Gaozong's singing and dancing in the lakes and mountains cannot be understood merely from a perspective of weakness. 

Wang Kunxia wrote a travel record titled "Yandang Travelogue," and Zhu Daojiang selected a line from it to hang as a scroll. The excerpt goes: "On the seventeenth day of the fourth month, we leisurely left the Small Stone Gate and arrived at Beinan. Lost in appreciation, we sat beneath a tree and awaited the moonrise.[96p]
Feeling weary and desiring a brief rest, I let the mountain breeze blow through my clothes, causing a shiver that abruptly awakened me. Faintly, I heard someone speaking: "The night air is clear, exceptionally tranquil, surpassing even the captivating scenes depicted in paintings of golden mountains and green waters." I thought it must be the companion who had arrived during the night. Suddenly, they continued: "The ancient qin bears the inscription 'Clouds pervade the empty mountains, deep waters echo with countless sounds. No traces of humans in antiquity, only towering and precipitous rocks.'"[97p]
"It is truly marvelous how he captures the essence of difficult scenes. I once asked Hong Guozi to paint this concept, but he couldn't put brush to paper." I secretly wonder who this person is that he has seen Jing Hao. I rise and sit to listen. He continues, "Not long ago, Dongpo painted half of a wall with bamboo, dividing the branches and leaves like the spring clouds emerging from the peaks, sparse and dense, naturally expressing the desired effect, without the appearance of angry branches and forced expansiveness." Another person speaks up, "Recently, I have read his poem 'Xitiantou', and it is like a clear autumn river, the misty water extending into the distance. The old crane's long cry and the distant sound of a cold gust of wind also dissipate the tangled and fluctuating energy."[98p]
"The brush of a talented scholar is dedicated and diligent; the brush of a celestial being is naturally exquisite, hence their realms differ. Recognizing him as a divine being, I stood up and looked up at him. Suddenly, there was a fluttering sound, and mountain flowers fell scattered as two birds flew into the clouds." The poem includes the line "Noble deeds are often laughed away by the carefree, while cranes witness the virtuous deeds of Xu Zuoqing," which records this incident. Liu Nishi, a member of the Liu family living in the mountains, lost a golden hairpin. He interrogated a young female servant and found out that she had sold it to a beggar who played the drum (in the capital, there are many idle wanderers; women wait at home and their husbands sneak out in the daytime, carrying two bamboo baskets and playing a small drum with a short handle to buy and sell various items, which is called "playing the drum").[99p]
"Generally speaking, items stolen by servants, maids, and children are often acquired at a low price. Although they may not be considered as thieves, they are in fact the wings of theft. However, stolen goods are often small and of little value, with elusive traces that are difficult to investigate. Therefore, even the law of the king cannot effectively prevent such actions."[100p]
The person repeatedly questioned the drummer about the shape of his clothes, but got no answer. Still persisting with the questioning, suddenly there was a faint cough from the dusty corner, saying, "I have been serving in your household for forty years, never once revealing my form or voice, so you didn't know of my existence. But now, I can no longer bear it! Is this necklace not something that Madam checked and mistakenly put in the lacquer box?" Following these words, the necklace was indeed found there, confirming the accuracy of the suspicion. However, the young servant girl was already badly injured. From then on, the person felt ashamed and remorseful forever, often saying to oneself, "There may always be such incidents from time to time, but how can one always encounter such a fox?" Therefore, during more than twenty years of official service, the person never resorted to torture in criminal investigations.[101p]
Once, in Jingzhou, I encountered a practitioner of Fuji, a ritual involving a wooden tablet used for communicating with spirits. Despite repeated summonings, the celestial beings refused to come. After burning another talisman, the wooden tablet shook vigorously for a long time and wrote a poem:

"Fated with a thin and fragile life, 
My lingering soul resembles floating puffs.
Tied to a three-foot-long string of white,
Like a red blossom withering on a branch.

Clouds and rain are long awaited,
But the misty waters remain impassable.
An autumn grave echoes with lonely ghosts,
Leaving behind regrets in the east of the Song dynasty."[102p]
Upon learning that I am the ghost of a suicide victim, she inquired about my name. In another letter, she wrote, "I am from the Wu region, a family of settlers in Chuze. By chance, our paths crossed, and we enjoyed a fleeting connection through letters. Unfortunately, our beautiful dream was shattered, and I was left in despair. In accordance with the rites of sages, a gentleman should mock me, but understanding the emotions of a daughter, a talented woman may show pity. I express my sorrow and grievances, but my name shall remain undisclosed."[103p]
"Her talent is no less than that of Li Qingzhao, and her children are also true descendants of sages and virtuous individuals. This is evident from their own self-evaluations. In the book "Xin Qi Xie," it is said that Lü Liuliang's crime recorded on the list of the underworld is "too excessive in opposing Buddhism." This must be untrue. Lü Liuliang's crime occurred after the downfall of the Ming Dynasty. He was neither able to escape poverty nor evade pursuit in the chaos of the era, living in obscurity and seclusion like a true hermit. He eventually passed the imperial examinations and obtained an official position, and his son Baozhong also achieved high academic success, entering the imperial academy as the second-ranked candidate."[104p]
For a long time, he sustained himself on meager rations, unable to compare himself to the stubbornness of the Yin dynasty. How could he dare to write slanderous books and confuse the common people? He cunningly relied on the barking of a dog to undermine and criticize Yao, showing his inconsistency and lack of foundation. In reality, his life was no different from that of Qian Qianyi. Upon his death, he naturally faced condemnation and punishment. As for his obsession with Confucianism and rejection of Buddhism, it was simply because of his admiration for Zhu Xi that he had to reject the teachings of Lu Xiangshan and Wang Yangming in favor of Chan Buddhism. Once he had rejected Chan Buddhism, he had no choice but to criticize Buddhism as well.[105p]
It is not their true aspiration, nor is it their true crime. Since the Jin people infiltrated our dreams, there have been many who deviate from the Buddha's teachings, and many who deviate excessively. To consider this as a sin would be to fear that the good will not have the opportunity to turn their words around. However, I have heard the words of the monk Mingyu from Mount Wutai, who said, "The deviant teachings of turning away from the Buddha are deeply ingrained in Song Confucianism but superficial in Changli. Although the followers who wear monastic robes fear Changli, they do not fear Song Confucianism, and they hold grudges against Changli, not Song Confucianism."[106p]
The teachings advocated by Chang Li are for the ignorant couples, who practice offering and providing assistance to the Buddha. The teachings advocated by the Song Confucian scholars, on the other hand, aim at enlightening the mind and realizing one's true nature, intended for the literati and officials. In society, there are few literati and officials but many ignorant couples. Most of the resources provided to the monastic community come from literati and officials, while resources from ignorant couples are scarce. If Chang Li's teachings prevail, then the incense will accumulate without generating smoke, and the temple will have no place, even if there are great wise masters who can lead countless followers and preaching tirelessly in difficult conditions. This is like cutting off the enemy's supply lines before launching an attack, making them collapse without need for direct combat. Therefore, there is great fear of Chang Li's teachings, and there is also great opposition towards them. If the teachings advocated by the Song Confucian scholars prove to be superior, it would only apply to Confucianism, its principles and its laws. You do not have to follow me, but if the principles and laws of Buddhism are as I have explained, then I also do not need to follow you.[107p]
Respected individuals, what you have heard and what you have learned from your respective fields are mutually reinforcing and not harmful. Therefore, there is no fear of the Confucian scholars of the Song Dynasty, nor is there a strong disdain for them. However, the Confucian scholars before the Tang Dynasty had practicality in their every word, while the Confucian scholars after the Song Dynasty engaged in empty talk in every matter. The scholars who criticize the Buddhists have done no harm to the teachings of Buddhism; they are merely making noise. If their criticisms are recorded as achievements, it is indeed a matter of debate; if considered as faults, it is also worth paying attention to and reflecting upon.[108p]
Wang Fa, the servant, returned from his night hunting. Under the moonlight, he saw a person being held by two others, each grabbing an arm. They were moving in opposite directions, but there was no sound. Wang Fa suspected that they were robbing the person of their clothes in the dark. So he fired a gun into the empty space. The two figures scattered in panic, and one of them fled while the other disappeared in an instant. Wang Fa realized then that they were ghosts.[109p]
As I reached the entrance of the village, a family's lights flickered as people came and went, their voices buzzing in the air. They were saying, "The new bride was hanged but revived." The woman said, "My aunt ordered me to make pancakes for dinner and give two or three to the dog. My aunt suspected me of stealing a bite and slapped my cheek in anger. Feeling wronged, I stood foolishly under a tree. Suddenly, another woman came to persuade me, saying, 'If you bear such injustice, it is better to die.'"[110p]
Hesitant and undecided, another woman came in a timid and fearful manner. Lost and confused, as if unaware of herself. She proceeded to untie her belt to hang herself, with the help of the other woman. Suffocated and in pain, almost unable to express her condition, gradually falling asleep, unaware that her body had already left the house. One woman said, "I advised her before, it is now my turn to take her place."[111p]
A woman said, "If I had not arrived later, I would have made the decision. I will represent myself." While they were arguing and fighting, suddenly there was a loud thunder, and the flames illuminated the surroundings. The two women were frightened and ran away. That's when I was able to return home. After this incident, whenever I went out at night, I would always hear cries and curses from afar, saying, "You ruined my plans, I swear I will kill you." However, I was not afraid.[112p]
One night, I heard cries and scolding again. He scolded, "You killed while I saved, and now you report to the gods. I am also in the right. If you dare to kill, then kill, why pretend to be scared!" From then on, he cut off all relations. However, helping others from death also attracts the resentment of those who want to kill. Shouldn't there be more people who remain uninvolved? This slave can also be considered somewhat different.

Mr. Song Qingyuan once said that when he was studying under Mr. Wang Tanzhai, a friend told him about a dream where he wandered into the Underworld and saw dozens of people in official attire entering one by one. The King of the Underworld questioned them for a long time and then they left one by one, each with a guilty look on their face.[113p]
Once, I encountered an officer whom I seemed to recognize but couldn't remember his name. I greeted him and he responded in kind. Curious, I asked, "Who are you, and what is your position?" The officer smiled and said, "You also serve in the government; wouldn't you have close acquaintances there?" I replied, "I have only served in the study department twice and haven't been assigned to any official position yet." The officer replied, "So you truly do not know. This is what we call the 'Four Rescues' expert." I inquired, "What does 'Four Rescues' mean?" He explained, "Among those who serve in the government, there is a saying: 'Rescue the living, not the dead; rescue officials, not the people; rescue the high-ranking, not the low-ranking; rescue the old, not the new.'[114p]
"To save the living and not the dead, for the dead are already gone and cannot be saved. But the living still have a chance, and to sacrifice their lives in order to balance the scales would only result in more deaths. Thus, it is better to find a compromise and let go. Whether the deceased bear grievances or not is not a consideration.

To save officials and not the common people, in cases brought before higher authorities, if the injustices are exposed, the officials' fortunes and misfortunes are incalculable. If they are not brought to light, they may face repercussions in the future, but it would be no more than a temporary setback. Whether the official's judgement is fair or not is not a consideration.

To save the powerful and not the weak, if the blame falls on higher-ranking officials, those in positions of power will face heavier condemnation, and many others will be implicated. If the blame falls on lower-ranking officials, those with less responsibility will receive lighter penalties, and the conclusion will be reached more easily. Whether the lower-ranking official deserves blame or not is not a consideration.

To save the established and not the new, if the old official has already left without resolving their matters, they may be burdened with unfinished business. If the new official has just arrived and is still getting acquainted, they may need time to handle things properly. Whether the new official is capable or not is not a consideration.

All of these actions are guided by the principles of a noble-hearted person, carrying out the duties of loyalty and integrity, without seeking personal gain or resorting to clever rhetoric. It is also not driven by personal grudges or a desire for revenge."[115p]
Human emotions and situations are varied and ever-changing, so it is impossible to generalize with a single perspective. If one stubbornly adheres to such a principle, it would be distorting the truth and causing unintended consequences, turning what should bring happiness into calamity and what should resolve issues into their exacerbation. Such occurrences happen quite often. The current situation, which is causing harm, is a result of this. 

Someone asked, "What will be the consequences?" The reply was, "As you sow, so shall you reap; as you plant melons, you get melons; as you plant beans, you get beans. Our past actions have consequences, and the karmic conditions will eventually come together. In future lives, we will simply encounter different teachers for salvation, or we may not encounter any teacher at all."[116p]
In the midst of contemplation, suddenly awakened, with no apparent reason for being immersed in a dream. Could it be that divine beings have been falsely informing people?[117p]


Below is the original Chinese:


朱導江言，有妻服已釋忽為禮懺者，意甚哀切，過於初喪。問之，初不言，所親或私叩之，乃泫然曰：「亡婦相聚半生，初未覺其有顯過。頃忽夢至冥司，見女子數百人，鎖以銀鐺，驅以骨朵，入一大官署中。俄聞號呼悽慘，栗魄動魂，既而一一引出，並流血被骭，匍匐膝行，如牽羊豕。中一人見我招手，視即亡婦。[1p]
驚問：『何罪至此？』曰：『坐事事與君懷二意。初謂家庭常態，不意陰律至嚴，與欺父欺君竟同一理，故墮落如斯。』問：『二意者何事？』曰：『不過骨肉之中私庇子女，奴隸之中私庇婢媼，親串之中私庇母黨，均使君不知而已。今每至月朔，必受鐵杖三十，未知何日得脫，此累累者皆是也。』尚欲再言，已為鬼卒曳去。[2p]
多年伉儷，未免有情，故為營齋造福耳。」夫同牢之禮，於情最親，親則非疏者所能間；敵體之義，於分本尊，尊則非卑者所能違。故二人同心，則家庭之纖微曲折，男子所不能知，與知而不能自為者，皆足以彌縫其闕。苟徇其私愛，意有所偏，則機械百出，亦可於耳目所不及者，無所不為。種種釁端，種種敗壞，皆從是起；所關者大，則其罪自不得輕。[3p]
況信之者至深，托之者至重，而欺其不覺，為所欲為，在朋友猶屬負心，應幹神譴，則人原一體，分屬三綱者，其負心之罪，不更加倍蓗乎？尋常細故，斷以嚴刑，因不得謂之深文矣。　　人情狙詐，無過於京師。餘嘗買羅小華墨十六鋌，漆匣黯敝，真舊物也。試之，乃摶泥而染以黑色，其上白霜，亦盦於濕地所生。又丁卯鄉試，在小寓買燭，爇之不燃。[4p]
乃泥質而冪以羊脂。又燈下有唱賣爐鴨者，從兄萬周買之。乃盡食其肉，而完其全骨，內傅以泥，外糊以紙，染為炙爆之色，塗以油，惟兩掌頭頸為真。又奴子趙平以二千錢買得皮靴，甚自喜。一日驟雨，著以出，徒跣而歸。[5p]
蓋靿則烏油高麗紙揉作縐紋，底則糊黏敗絮緣之以布。其他作偽多類此，然猶小物也。有選人見對門少婦甚端麗，問之，乃其夫遊幕，寄家於京師，與母同居。越數月，忽白紙糊門，全家號哭，則其夫訃音至矣。設位祭奠，誦經追薦，亦頗有弔者。[6p]
既而漸鬻衣物，雲乏食且議嫁。選人因贅其家。又數月，突其夫生還，始知為誤傳凶問。夫怒甚，將訟官。母女哀籲，乃盡留其囊篋，驅選人出。[7p]
越半載，選人在巡城禦史處，見此婦對簿。則先歸者乃婦所歡，合謀挾取選人財，後其夫真歸而敗也。黎丘之技，不愈出愈奇乎？又西城有一宅，約四五十楹，月租二十餘金。有一人住半載餘，恒先期納租，因不過問。一日，忽閉門去，不告主人。[8p]
主人往視，則縱橫瓦礫，無復寸椽，惟前後臨街屋僅在。蓋是宅前後有門，居者於後門設木肆，販鬻屋材，而陰拆宅內之樑柱門窗，間雜賣之。各居一巷，故人不能覺。累棟連甍，搬運無跡，尤神乎技矣。然是五六事，或以取賤值，或以取便易，因貪受餌，其咎亦不盡在人。[9p]
錢文敏公曰：「與京師人作緣，斤斤自守，不入陷阱已幸矣。稍見便宜，必藏機械，神奸巨蠹，百怪千奇，豈有便宜到我輩。」誠哉是言也。　　王青士言，有弟謀奪兄產者，招訟師至密室，篝燈籌畫。訟師為設機布阱，一一周詳，並反間內應之術，無不曲到。[10p]
謀既定，訟師掀髯曰：「令兄雖猛如虎豹，亦難出鐵網矣。然何以酬我乎？」弟感謝曰：「與君至交，情同骨肉，豈敢忘大德？」時兩人對據一方幾，忽幾下一人突出，繞室翹一足而跳舞，目光如炬，長毛毿毿如蓑衣，指訟師曰：「先生斟酌，此君視先生如骨肉，先生其危乎？」且笑且舞，躍上屋簷而去。二人與侍側童子並驚僕。家人覺聲息有異，相呼入視，已昏不知人。灌治至夜半，童子先蘇，具述所聞見。[11p]
二人至曉乃能動。事機已泄，人言藉藉，竟寢其謀，閉門不出者數月。相傳有狎一妓者，相愛甚。然欲為脫籍，則拒不從，許以別宅自居，禮數如嫡，拒益力。怪詰其故，喟然曰：「君棄其結髮而匿我，此豈可托終身者乎？」與此鬼之言，可雲所見略同矣。[12p]
　　張夫人，先祖母之妹，先叔之外姑也。病革時顧侍者曰：「不起矣。聞將死者見先亡，今見之矣。」即而環顧病榻，若有所覓。喟然曰：「錯矣。[13p]
」俄又拊枕曰：「大錯矣。」俄又瞑目齧齒，掐掌有痕，曰：「真大錯矣！」疑為譫語，不敢問。良久，盡呼女媳至榻前，告之曰：「吾向以為夫族疏而母族親，今來導者皆夫族，無母族也。吾向以為媳疏而女親，今亡媳在左右，而亡女不見也。非一氣者相關，異派者不屬乎？回思平日之存心，非厚其所薄，薄其所厚乎？吾一誤矣，爾曹勿再誤也。[14p]
」此三叔母張太宜人所親聞。婦女偏私，至死不悟者多矣，此猶是大智慧人，能回頭猛省也。　　孔子有言：「諫有五，吾從其諷。」聖人之究悉物情也。親串中一婦，無子而陰忮其庶子；姪若婿又媒櫱短長，私黨膠固，殆不可以理喻。[15p]
婦有老乳母，年八十餘矣。聞之，匍匐入謁，一拜，輒痛哭曰：「老奴三日不食矣。」婦問：「曷不依爾姪？」曰：「老奴初有所蓄積，姪事我如事母，誘我財盡。今如不相識，求一盂飯不得矣。」又問：「曷不依爾女若婿？」曰：「婿誘我財如我姪，我財盡後，棄我亦如我姪，雖我女無如何也。[16p]
」又問：「至親相負，曷不訟之？」曰：「訟之矣，官以為我已出嫁，於本宗為異姓；女已出嫁，又於我為異姓。其收養為格外情，其不收養，律無罪，弗能直也。」又問：「爾將來奈何？」曰：「亡夫昔隨某官在外，娶婦生一子，今長成矣。吾訟姪與婿時，官以為既有此子，當養嫡母，不養則律當重誅。已移牒拘喚，但不知何日至耳。[17p]
」婦爽然若失。自是所為遂漸改。此親戚族黨，唇焦舌敝不能爭者，而此嫗以數言回其意。現身說法，言之者無罪，聞之者足以戒耳。觸龍之於趙太后，蓋用此術矣。[18p]
第十八卷姑妄聽之四　　馬德重言，滄州城南，盜劫一富室，已破扉入，主人夫婦並被執，眾莫敢誰何。有妾居東廂，變服逃匿廚下，私語灶婢曰：「主人在盜手，是不敢與鬥。渠輩屋脊各有人，以防救應；然不能見簷下。汝抉後窗循簷出，密告諸僕：『各乘馬執械，四面伏三五裡外，盜四更後必出。四更不出，則天曉不能歸巢也。[19p]
出必挾主人送，苟無人阻，則行一二裡必釋，不釋恐見其去向也。俟其釋主人，急負還。而相率隨其後，相去務在半裡內。彼如返鬥即奔還，彼止亦止，彼行又隨行，再返鬥仍奔，再止仍止，再行仍隨行。如此數四，彼不返鬥，則隨之得其巢；彼返鬥，則既不得戰，又不得遁，逮至天明，無一人得脫矣。[20p]
』婢冒死出告。眾以為中理，如其言，果並就擒。重賞灶婢。妾與嫡故不甚協，至是亦相睦。後問妾：「何以辦此？」泫然曰：「吾故盜魁某甲女，父在時，嘗言行劫所畏惟此法，然未見有用之者。[21p]
今事急姑試，竟僥倖驗也。」故曰，用兵者務得敵之情。又曰，以賊攻賊。　　戴東原言，有狐居人家空屋中，與主人通言語，致饋遺，或互假器物，相安若比鄰。一日，狐告主人曰：「君別院空屋，有縊鬼多年矣。[22p]
君近拆是屋，鬼無所棲，乃來與我爭屋。時時現惡狀，恐怖小兒女，已自可憎，又作祟使患寒熱，尤不堪忍。某觀道士能劾鬼，君盍求之除此害。」主人果求得一符，焚於院中。俄暴風驟起，聲轟然如雷霆。[23p]
方駭愕間，聞屋瓦格格亂鳴，如數十人奔走踐踏者，屋上呼曰：「吾計大左，悔不及！頃神將下擊，鬼縛而吾亦被驅，今別君去矣！」蓋不忍其憤，急於一逞，未有不兩敗俱傷者。觀於此狐，可為炯鑒。又呂氏表兄言（忘其名字，先姑之長子也。），有人患狐祟，延術士禁咒。狐去而術士需索無厭，時遣木人紙虎之類至其家擾人，賂之，暫止。[24p]

疑為目眩，然矛上地上，皆有血跡，不知何怪。餘謂此必山精也。深山大澤，何所不育。《白澤圖》所載，雖多附會，殆亦有之。又言，有一遊兵，見黑物蹲石上，疑為熊，引滿射之，三發皆中，而此物夷然如不知。[26p]

鄉人病之，而無如何。有角妓號玉面狐者曰：「是易與，第備錢以待可耳。」乃自詣其家，曰：「我為鴇母錢樹，鴇母顧虐我。昨與勃谿，約我以千金自贖。我亦厭倦風塵，願得一忠厚長者托終身，念無如公者。[32p]
公能捐千金，則終身執巾櫛。聞公不喜積金，即錢二千貫亦足抵。昨有木商聞此事，已回天津取資，計其到當在半月外。我不願隨此庸奴，公能於十日內先定，則受德多矣。」張故惑此妓，聞之驚喜，急出穀賤售。[33p]
廩已開，買者坌至，不能復閉，遂空其所積，米價大平。穀盡之日，妓遣謝富室曰：「鴇母養我久，一時負氣相詬，致有是議。今悔過挽留，義不可負心。所言姑俟諸異日。」富室原與私約，無媒無證，無一錢聘定，竟無如何也。[34p]

前以人來，人有人理，不敢不忍詬；今以狐來，變幻無端，出入無跡，彼烏得而知之？」因嬿婉如初。久而漸為童婢泄。嫡大恚，多金募術士劾治。一術士檄將拘妾至，妾不服罪，攘臂與術士爭曰：「無子納妾，則納為有理；生子遣妾，則夫為負心。無故見出，罪不在我。[37p]
」術士曰：「既見出矣，豈可私歸？」妾曰：「出母未嫁，與子未絕；出婦未嫁，於夫亦未絕。況鬻我者妒婦，非見出於夫。夫仍納我，是未出也，何不可歸？」術士怒曰：「爾本獸類，何敢據人理爭？」妾曰：「人變獸心，陰律陽律皆有刑。獸變人心，反以為罪，法師據何憲典耶？」術士益怒曰：「吾持五雷法，知誅妖耳，不知其他！」妾大笑曰：「妖亦天地之一物，苟其無罪，天地未嘗不並育。上帝所不誅，法師乃欲盡誅乎？」術士拍案曰：「媚惑男子，非爾罪耶？」妾曰：「我以禮納，不得為媚惑。[38p]
倘其媚惑，則攝精吸氣，此生久槁矣。今在家兩年，復歸又五六年，康強無恙，所謂媚惑者安在？法師受妒婦多金，鍛煉周內，以酷濟貪耳，吾豈服耶？」問答之頃，術士顧所召神將，已失所在。無可如何，瞋目曰：「今不與爾爭，明日會當召雷部！」明日，嫡再促設壇，則宵遁矣。蓋所持之法雖正，而法以賄行，故魅亦不畏，神將亦不滿也。相傳劉念臺先生官總憲時，題禦史臺一聯曰：「無欲常教心似水，有言自覺氣如霜。[39p]

行半裡許，至一地，空曠如墟墓，見一鬼，狀貌如人，而鼻下則無口。問：「此何故？」曰：「是人生時，巧於應對，諛詞頌語媚世悅人，故受此報，使不能語。或遇燄口漿水，則飲以鼻。」又見一鬼，尻聳向上，首折向下，面著於腹，以兩手支拄而行。問：「此何故？」曰：「是人生時，妄自尊大，故受此報，使不能仰面傲人。[42p]
」又見一鬼，自胸至腹，裂罅數寸，五臟六腑，虛無一物。問：「此何故？」曰：「是人生時，城府深隱，人不能測，故受是報，使中無匿形。」又見一鬼，足長二尺，指巨如椎，踵巨如鬥，重如千斛之舟，努力半刻，始移一寸。問：「此何故？」曰：「此人生時，高材捷足，事事務居人先，故受是報，使不能行。」又見一鬼，兩耳拖地，如曳雙翼，而混沌無竅。[43p]
問：「此何故？」曰：「此人生時，懷忌多疑，喜聞蜚語，故受此報，使不能聽。是皆按惡業淺深，待受報期滿，始入轉輪。其罪減地獄一等，如陽律之徒流也。」俄見車騎雜遝，一冥官經過，見鄉人，驚曰：「此是生魂，誤遊至此，恐迷不得歸。誰識其家，可導使去。[44p]
」友跪啟：「是舊交。」官即令送返。將至門，大汗而醒，自是病癒。雪崖天性爽朗，胸中落落無宿物，與朋友諧戲，每俊辯橫生，此當是其寓言，未必真有。然莊生、《列子》，半屬寓言，義足勸懲，固不必刻舟求劍爾。[45p]
　　陳半江言，有書生，月夕遇一婦，色頗姣麗。挑以微詞，欣然相就。自雲家在鄰近，而不肯言姓名。又雲夫恒數日一外出，家有後窗可開，有牆缺可逾，遇隙即來，不能預定期也。如是五六年，情好甚至。[46p]
一歲，書生將遠行，婦夜來話別。書生言：「隨人作計，後會無期。」淒戀萬狀，哽咽至不成語。婦忽嬉笑曰：「君如此情癡，必相思致疾，非我初來相就意。實與君言，我鬼之待替者也。[47p]
凡人與鬼狎，無不病且死，陰剝陽也。惟我以愛君韶秀，不忍玉折蘭摧，故必越七八日後，待君陽復，乃肯再來。有剝有復，故君能無恙。使遇他鬼，則縱情冶蕩，不出半載，索君於枯魚之肆矣。我輩至多，求如我者則至少，君其宜慎。[48p]
感君義重，此所以報也。」語訖，散髮吐舌作鬼形，長嘯而去。書生震栗幾失魂，自是雖遇冶容，曾不側視。　　王梅序言，交河有為盜誣引者，鄉民樸願，無以自明，以賂求援於縣吏。吏聞盜之誣引，由私調其婦致為所毆，意其婦必美，卻賂，而微示以意曰：「此事秘密，須其婦潛身自來，乃可授方略。[49p]
」居間者以告鄉民。鄉民憚死失志，呼婦母至獄，私語以故。母告婦，咈然不應也。越兩三日，吏家有人夜扣門。啟視，則一丐婦，布帕裹首，衣百結破衫，闖然入。[50p]
問之不答，且行且解衫與帕，則鮮妝華服豔婦也。驚問所自，紅潮暈頰，俯首無言，惟袖出片紙。就所持燈視之，「某人妻」三字而已。吏喜過望，引入內室，故問其來意。婦掩淚曰：「不喻君語，何以夜來？既已來此，不必問矣，惟祈毋失信耳。[51p]
」吏發洪誓，遂相嬿婉。潛留數日，大為婦所蠱惑，神志顛倒，惟恐不得當婦意。婦暫辭去，言村中日日受侮，難於久住，如城中近君租數楹，便可托庇廕，免無賴淩藉，亦可朝夕相往來。吏益喜，竟百計白其冤。獄解之後，遇鄉民，意甚索漠。[52p]
以為狎昵其婦，愧相見也。後因事到鄉，詣其家，亦拒不見。知其相絕，乃大恨。會有挾妓誘博者訟於官，官斷妓押歸原籍。吏視之，鄉民婦也。[53p]
就與語。婦言苦為夫禁制，愧相負，相憶殊深，今幸相逢，乞念舊時數日歡，免杖免解。吏又惑之。因告官曰：「妓所供乃母家籍，實縣民某妻，宜究其夫。」蓋覬慫慂官賣，自買之也。[54p]
遣拘鄉民，鄉民攜妻至，乃別一人。問鄉裡皆雲不偽，問吏：「何以誣鄉民？」吏不能對，第曰：「風聞。」問：「聞之何人？」則噤無語。呼妓問之，妓乃言：「吏初欲挾汙鄉民妻，妻念從則失身不從則夫死，值妓新來，乃盡脫簪珥賂妓冒名往，故與吏狎識。今當受杖，適與相逢，因仍誑托鄉民妻，冀脫棰楚，不虞其又有他謀，致兩敗也。[55p]
」官覆勘鄉民，果被誣。姑念其計出救死，又出於其妻，釋不究，而嚴懲此吏焉。神奸巨蠹，莫吏若矣，而為村婦所籠絡，如玩弄嬰孩。蓋愚者恒為智者敗，而物極必反，亦往往於所備之外，有智出其上者突起而勝之。無往不復，天之道也。[56p]
使智者終不敗，則天地間惟智者存，愚者斷絕矣。有是理哉！　　鬼魘人至死，不知何意。倪餘疆曰：「吾聞諸施亮生矣，取啖其生魂耳。蓋鬼為餘氣，漸消漸減，以至於無，得生魂之氣以益之，則又可再延。故女鬼恒欲與人狎，攝其精也；男鬼不能攝人精，則殺人而吸其生氣，均猶狐之採補耳。[57p]
」因憶劉挺生言，康熙庚子，有五舉子，晚遇雨，棲破寺中。四人已眠，惟一人眠未穩，覺陰風颯然，有數黑影自牖入，向四人噓氣，四人即夢魘。又向一人噓氣，心雖了了，而亦漸昏瞀，覺似有拖曳之者。及稍醒，已離故處，似被縶縛，欲呼則噤不能聲。視四人，亦縱橫偃臥，眾鬼共舉一人啖之，斯須而盡；又以次食二人。[58p]
至第四人，忽有老翁自外入，厲聲叱曰：「野鬼無造次！此二人有祿相，不可犯也。」眾鬼駭散，二人倏然自醒，述所見相同。後一終於教諭，一終於訓導。鮑敬亭先生聞之，笑曰：「平生自薄此官，不料為鬼神所重也。」觀其所言，似亮生之說不虛矣。[59p]
　　李慶子言，朱生立園，辛酉北應順天試。晚過羊留之北，因繞避泥濘，遂迂迴失道，無逆旅可棲，遙見林外有人家，試往投止。至則土垣瓦舍，凡六七楹，一童子出應門。朱具道乞宿意。一翁衣冠樸雅，延賓入，止旁舍中。[60p]
呼燈至，黯黯無光。翁曰：「歲歉油不佳，殊令人悶，然無如何也。」又曰：「夜深不能具肴饌，村酒小飲，勿以為褻。」意甚款洽。朱問：「家中有何人？」曰：「零丁孤苦，惟老妻與僮婢同居耳。[61p]
」問朱何適，朱告以北上。曰：「有一劄及少物欲致京中，僻路苦無書郵，今遇君甚幸。」朱問：「四無鄰裡，獨居不怖乎？」曰：「薄田數畝，課奴輩耕作，因就之卜居。貧無儲蓄，不畏盜也。」朱曰：「謂曠野多鬼魅耳。[62p]
」翁曰：「鬼魅即未見。君如怖是，陪坐至天曙，可乎？」因借朱紙筆，入作書劄；又以雜物封函內，以舊布裹束，密縫其外。付朱曰：「居址已寫於函上，君至京拆視自知。」天曙作別，又切囑信物勿遺失，始慇懃分手。朱至京，拆視布裹，則函題朱立園先生啟字，其物乃金簪銀釧各一雙，其劄稱：「僕老無子息，誤惑婦言，以婿為嗣。[63p]
至外孫猶間一祭掃，後則視為異姓。紙錢麥飯，久已闕如；三尺孤墳，亦就傾圮。九泉茹痛，百悔難追。謹以殉棺薄物，祈君貨鬻。歸途以所得之直，修治荒塋，並稍濬塚南水道，庶淫潦不浸幽窀。[64p]
如允所祈，定如杜回結草。知君畏鬼，當暗中稽首，不敢見形，勿滋疑慮。亡人楊寧頓首。」朱駭汗浹背，方知遇鬼，以書中歸途之語，知必不售，既而果然。還至羊留，以所賣簪釧錢遣僕往治其墓，竟不敢再至焉。[65p]
　　吳雲巖言，有秦生者，不畏鬼，恒以未一見為歉。一夕，散步別業，聞樹外朗吟唐人詩曰：「自去自來人不知，歸時惟對空山月。」其聲哀厲而長。隔葉窺之，一古衣冠人倚石坐。確知為鬼，遽前掩之。[66p]
鬼亦不避。秦生長揖曰：「與君路異幽明，人殊今古，邂逅相遇，無可寒溫。所以來者，欲一問鬼神情狀耳。敢問為鬼時何似？」曰：「一脫形骸，即已為鬼。如繭成蝶，亦不自知。[67p]
」問：「果魂升魄降，還入太虛乎？」曰：「自我為鬼，即在此間。今我全身現與君對，未嘗隨氤氳元氣，升降飛揚。子孫祭時始一聚，子孫祭畢則散也。」問：「果有神乎？」曰：「鬼既不虛，神自不妄。譬有百姓必有官師。[68p]
」問：「先儒稱雷神之類，皆旋生旋化，果不誣乎？」曰：「作措大時，飽聞是說。然竊疑霹靂擊格，轟然交作，如一雷一神，則神之數多於蚊蚋；如雷止神滅，則神之壽促於蜉蝣。以質先生，率遭呵叱。為鬼之後，乃知百神奉職，如世建官，皆非頃刻之幻影，恨不能以所聞見，再質先生。然爾時擁皋比者，計為鬼已久，當自知之，無庸再詰矣。[69p]
大抵無鬼之說聖人未有，諸大儒恐人諂瀆，故強造斯言。然禁沉湎可，並廢酒醴則不可；禁淫蕩可，並廢夫婦則不可；禁貪惏可，並廢財貨則不可；禁鬥爭可，並廢五兵則不可。故以一代盛名，挾百千萬億朋黨之助，能使人噤不敢語，而終不能愜服其心，職是故耳。傳其教者，雖心知不然，然不持是論，即不得稱為精義之學，亦違心而和之曰：『理必如是雲爾。』君不察先儒矯枉之意，生於相激，非其本心；後儒闢邪之說，壓於所畏，亦非其本心。[70p]
竟信儒者真謂無鬼神？皇皇質問，則君之受紿久矣。泉下之人，不欲久與生人接，君亦不宜久與鬼狎，言盡於此，餘可類推。」曼聲長嘯而去。案此謂儒者明知有鬼，故言無鬼，與黃山二鬼謂儒者明知井田封建不可行，故言可行，皆洞見癥結之論。僅目以迂闊，猶墜五裡霧中矣。[71p]
　　汪主事厚石言，有在西湖扶乩者，下壇詩曰：「舊埋香處草離離，只有西陵夜月知。詞客情多來弔古，幽魂腸斷看題詩。滄桑幾劫湖仍綠，雲雨千年夢尚疑。誰信靈山散花女，如今佛火對琉璃。」眾知為蘇小小也。[72p]
客或請曰：「仙姬生在南齊，何以亦能七律？」乩判曰：「閱歷歲時，幽明一理，性靈不昧，即與世推移。宣聖惟識大篆，祝詞何寫以隸書？釋迦不解華言，疏文何行以駢體？是知千載前人，其性識至今猶在，即能解今之語，通今之文。江文通、謝玄暉（編按：謝玄暉當係謝希逸之誤。）能作《愛妾換馬》八韻律賦（見於《纂異記》），沈休文子青箱，能作《金陵懷古》五言律詩，古有其事，又何疑於今乎？」又問：「尚能作永明體否？」即書四詩曰：「歡來不得來，儂去不得去。懊惱石尤風，一夜斷人渡。[73p]
」「歡從何處來？今日大風雨。濕盡杏子衫，辛苦皆因汝。」「結束蛺蝶裙，為歡棹舴艋。宛轉沿大堤，綠波雙照影。」「莫泊荷花汀，且泊楊柳岸。[74p]
花外有人行，柳深人不見。」蓋《子夜歌》也。雖才鬼依託，亦可雲俊辯矣。　　表兄安伊在言，河城秋獲時，有少婦抱子行塍上，忽失足僕地，臥不復起。獲者遙見之，疑有故，趨視，則已死。[75p]
子亦觸瓦角腦裂死。駭報田主，田主報裡胥。辨驗死者，數十裡內無此婦，且衣飾華潔，子亦銀釧紅綾衫，不類貧家，大惑不解。且覆以葦箔，更番守視，而急聞於官。河城去縣近，官次日晡時至，啟箔檢視，則中置槁稭一束，二屍已不見。[76p]
壓箔之磚固未動，守者亦未頃刻離也。官大怒，盡拘田主及守者去，多方鞫治，無絲毫謀殺棄屍狀。糾結繳繞至年餘，乃以疑案上。上官以案情恍惚，往返駁詰。又歲餘，乃姑俟訪，而是家已蕩然矣。[77p]
此康熙癸巳、甲午間事。相傳村南墟墓間，有黑狐夜夜拜月，人多見之。是家一子好弋獵，潛往伏伺，彀弩中其股。噭然長號，化火光西去。搜其穴，得二小狐，縶以返，旋逸去。[78p]
月餘，而有是事。疑狐變幻來報冤。然荒怪無據，人不敢以入供，官亦不敢入案牘，不能不以匿屍論。故紛擾至斯也。又言城西某村有丐婦，為姑所虐，縊於土神祠。[79p]
亦箔覆待檢，更番守視。官至，則屍與守者俱不見，亦窮治如河城。後七八年乃得之於安平（深州屬縣。）。蓋婦頗白皙，一少年輪守時，褫下裳而淫其屍，屍得人氣復生，竟相攜以逃也。[80p]
此康熙末事。或疑河城之事當類此，是未可知。或並為一事，則傳聞誤矣。　　同年龔肖夫言，有人四十餘無子，婦悍妒，萬無納妾理，恒鬱鬱不適。偶至道觀，有道士招之曰：「君氣色凝滯，似有重憂。[81p]
道家以濟物為念，盍言其實，或一效鉛刀之用乎？」異其言，具以告。道士曰：「固聞之，姑問君耳。君為製鬼卒衣裝十許具，當有以報命，如不能製，即假諸伶官亦可也。」心益怪之，然度其誑取無所用，當必有故，姑試其所為。是夕，婦夢魘，呼不醒，且呻吟號叫聲甚慘。[82p]
次日，兩股皆青黯。問之，秘不言，籲嗟而已。三日後復然。自是每三日後皆復然。半月後，忽遣奴喚媒媼，雲：「將買妾。[83p]
」人皆弗信。其夫亦慮後患，殊持疑。既而婦昏瞀累日，醒而促買妾愈急，布金於案，與僮僕約，三日不得必重抶，得而不佳亦重抶。觀其狀似非詭語，覓二女以應，並留之。是夕即整飾衾枕，促其夫入房。[84p]
舉家駭愕，莫喻其意，夫亦惘惘如夢境。後復見道士，始知其有術能攝魂，夜使觀中道眾為鬼裝，而道士星冠羽衣，坐堂上焚符攝婦魂，言其祖宗翁姑以斬祀不孝，具牒訴冥府，用桃杖決一百，遣歸，克期令納妾。婦初以為噩夢，尚未肯。俄三日一攝，如徵比然。其昏瞀累日，則倒懸其魂，灌鼻以醋，約三日不得好女子，即付泥犁也。[85p]
攝魂小術，本非正法，然法無邪正，惟人所用，如同一戈矛，用以殺掠則劫盜，用以征討則王師耳。術無大小，亦惟人所用，如不龜手之藥，可以洴澼絖，亦可以大敗越師耳。道士所謂善用其術歟！至囂頑悍婦，情理不能喻，法令不能禁，而道士能以術制之。堯牽一羊，舜從而鞭，羊不行，一牧豎驅之則群行。物各有所制，藥各有所畏。[86p]
神道設教，以馴天下之強梗，聖人之意深矣。講學家烏乎識之？　　褚鶴汀言，有太學生，貲巨萬。妻生一子死。再娶，豐於色，太學惑之。托言家政無佐理，迎其母至，母又攜二妹來。[87p]
不一載，其一兄二弟，亦挈家來。久而僮僕婢媼皆妻黨，太學父子，反煢煢若寄食。又久而筦鑰簿籍，錢粟出入，皆不與聞；殘杯冷炙，反遭厭薄矣。稍不能堪，欲還奪所侵權，則妻兄弟哄於外，妻母妹等詬於內。嘗為眾所聚毆，至落鬚敗面，呼救無應者。[88p]
其子狂奔至，一摑僕地，惟叩額乞緩死而已。恚不自勝，詣後圃將自經。忽一老人止之曰：「君勿爾。君家之事，神人共憤久矣。我居君家久，不平尤甚。[89p]
君但焚牒土神祠，雲乞遣後圃狐驅逐，神必許君。」如其言。是夕，果屋瓦亂鳴，窗扉震撼，妻黨皆為磚石所擊，破額流血。俄而妻黨婦女，並為狐媚；雖其母不免。晝則發狂裸走，醜詞褻狀，無所不至；夜則每室坌集數十狐，更番嬲戲。[90p]
不勝其創，哀乞聲相聞。廚中肴饌，俱攝置太學父子前，妻黨所食皆雜以穢物。知不可住，皆竄歸。太學乃稍稍召集舊僕，復理家政，始可以自存。妻黨覬覦未息，恒來探視。[91p]
入門輒被擊，或私有所攜，歸家則囊已空矣。其妻或私饋亦然。由是遂絕跡。然核計貲產損耗已甚，微狐力，則太學父子餓殍矣。此至親密友所不能代謀，此狐百計代謀之，豈狐之果勝人哉？人於世故深，故遠嫌畏怨，趨易避難，坐視而不救；狐則未諳世故，故不巧博忠厚長者名，義所當為，奮然而起也。[92p]
雖狐也，為之執鞭，所欣慕焉。　　瞽者劉君瑞言，一瞽者，年三十餘，恒往來衛河旁。遇泊舟者必問：「此有殷桐乎？」又必申之曰：「夏殷之殷，梧桐之桐也。」有與之同宿者，其夢中囈語，亦惟此二字。問其姓名，則旬日必一變，亦無深詰之者。[93p]
如是十餘年，人多識之。或逢其欲問，輒呼曰：「此無殷桐，別覓可也。」一日，糧艘泊河幹，瞽者問如初。一人挺身上岸，曰：「是爾耶？殷桐在此，爾何能為？」瞽者狂吼如虓虎，撲抱其頸，口齧其鼻，血淋漓滿地。眾拆解，牢不可開。[94p]
竟共墮河中，隨流而沒。後得屍於天妃宮前（海口不受屍，凡河中求屍不得，至天妃宮前必浮出。）桐捶其左脅骨盡斷，終不釋手；十指摳桐肩背，深入寸餘。兩顴兩頰，齧肉幾盡。迄不知其何仇，疑必父母之冤也。[95p]
夫以無目之人，偵有目之人，其不得決也；以孱弱之人，搏強橫之人，其不敵亦決也。如較伍胥之楚仇，其報更難矣。乃十餘年堅意不回，竟卒得而食其肉，豈非精誠之至，天地亦不能違乎！宋高宗之歌舞湖山，究未可以勢弱解也。　　王昆霞作《雁宕遊記》一卷，朱導江為餘書掛幅，摘其中一條雲：「四月十七日，晚出小石門，至北磵。耽玩忘返，坐樹下待月上。[96p]
倦欲微眠，山風吹衣，慄然忽醒。微聞人語曰：『夜氣澄清，尤為幽絕，勝罨畫圖中看金碧山水。』以為同遊者夜至也。俄又曰：『古琴銘雲：「山虛水深，萬籟蕭蕭。古無人蹤，惟石嶕嶢。[97p]
」真妙寫難狀之景。嘗乞洪穀子畫此意，竟不能下筆。』竊訝斯是何人，乃見荊浩？起坐聽之。又曰：『頃東坡為畫竹半壁，分柯布葉，如春雲出岫，疏疏密密，意態自然，無杈椏怒張之狀。』又一人曰：『近見其西天目詩，如空江秋淨，煙水渺然，老鶴長唳，清飈遠引，亦消盡縱橫之氣。[98p]
緣才子之筆，務殫心巧；飛仙之筆，妙出天然，境界故不同耳。』知為仙人，立起仰視。忽撲簌一聲，山花亂落，有二鳥衝雲去。」其詩有「躡屐頗笑謝康樂，化鶴親見徐佐卿」句，即記此事也。　　劉擬山家失金釧，掠問小女奴，具承賣與打鼓者（京師無賴遊民多，婦女在家倚門，其夫白晝避出，擔二荊筐，操短柄小鼓擊之，收買雜物，謂之打鼓。[99p]
凡童婢、幼孩竊出之物，多以賤價取之。蓋雖不為盜，實盜之羽翼。然贓物細碎，所值不多，又蹤跡詭秘，無可究詰。故王法亦不能禁也。）。[100p]
又掠問打鼓者衣服形狀，求之不獲。仍復掠問，忽承塵上微嗽曰：「我居君家四十年，不肯一露形聲，故不知有我。今則實不能忍矣！此釧非夫人檢點雜物，誤置漆奩中耶？」如言求之，果不謬。然小女奴已無完膚矣。擬山終身愧悔，恒自道之曰：「時時不免有此事，安能處處有此狐？」故仕宦二十餘載，鞫獄未嘗以刑求。[101p]
　　多小山言，嘗於景州見扶乩者，召仙不至。再焚符，乩搖撼良久，書一詩曰：「薄命輕如葉，殘魂轉似蓬。練拖三尺白，花謝一枝紅。雲雨期雖久，煙波路不通。秋墳空鬼唱，遺恨宋家東。[102p]

」此才不減李清照，其聖賢兒女一聯，自評亦確也。　　《新齊諧》載冥司榜呂留良之罪曰：「辟佛太過。」此必非事實也。留良之罪，在明亡以後，既不能首陽一餓，追跡夷齊；又不能戢影逃名，鴻冥世外，如真山民之比。乃青衿應試，身列膠庠；其子葆中，亦高掇科名，以第二人入翰苑。[104p]
則久食周粟，斷不能自比殷頑。何得肆作謗書，熒惑黔首？詭托於桀犬之吠堯，是首鼠兩端，進退無據，實狡黠反覆之尤。核其生平，實與錢謙益相等。歿罹陰譴，自必由斯。至其講學辟佛，則以尊朱之故，不得不辟陸、王為禪；既已辟禪，自不得不牽連辟佛。[105p]
非其本志，亦非其本罪也。金人入夢以來，辟佛者多，辟佛太過者亦多。以是為罪，恐留良轉有詞矣。抑嘗聞五臺僧明玉之言曰：「辟佛之說，宋儒深而昌黎淺，宋儒精而昌黎粗。然而披緇之徒，畏昌黎不畏宋儒，銜昌黎不銜宋儒也。[106p]
蓋昌黎所辟，檀施供養之佛也，為愚夫婦言之也；宋儒所辟，明心見性之佛也，為士大夫言之也。天下士大夫少而愚夫婦多，僧徒之所取給，亦資於士大夫者少，資於愚夫婦者多。使昌黎之說勝，則香積無煙，祇園無地，雖有大善知識，能率恒河沙眾，枵腹露宿而說法哉！此如用兵者，先斷糧道，不攻而自潰也。故畏昌黎甚，銜昌黎亦甚。使宋儒之說勝，不過爾儒理如是，儒法如是，爾不必從我；我佛理如是，佛法如是，我亦不必從爾。[107p]
各尊所聞，各行所知，兩相枝拄，未有害也。故不畏宋儒，亦不甚銜宋儒。」然則唐以前之儒，語語有實用；宋以後之儒，事事皆空談。講學家之辟佛，於釋氏毫無所加損，徒喧哄耳。錄以為功，固為讜論；錄以為罪，亦未免重視留良耳。[108p]
　　奴子王發，夜獵歸。月明之下，見一人為二人各捉一臂，東西牽曳，而寂不聞聲。疑為昏夜之中，剝奪衣物，乃向空虛鳴一銃。二人奔迸散去，一人返奔歸，倏皆不見。方知為鬼。[109p]
比及村口，則一家燈火出入，人語嘈囋雲：「新婦縊死復甦矣。」婦雲：「姑命晚餐作餅，為犬銜去兩三枚。姑疑竊食，痛批其頰。冤抑莫白，癡立樹下。俄一婦來勸：『如此負屈，不如死。[110p]
』猶豫未決，又一婦來慫慂之。恍惚迷瞀，若不自知。遂解帶就縊，二婦助之。悶塞痛苦，殆難言狀，漸似睡去，不覺身已出門外。一婦曰：『我先勸，當代我。[111p]
』一婦曰：『非我後至不能決，當代我。』方爭奪間，忽霹靂一聲，火光四照，二婦驚走。我乃得歸也。」後發夜歸，輒遙聞哭詈，言：「破壞我事，誓必相殺。」發亦不畏。[112p]
一夕，又聞哭詈，發訶曰：「爾殺人我救人，即告於神，我亦理直。敢殺即殺，何必虛相恐怖！」自是遂絕。然則救人於死，亦招欲殺者之怨，宜袖手者多歟？此奴亦可雲小異矣。　　宋清遠先生言，昔在王坦齋先生學幕時，一友言，夢游至冥司，見衣冠數十人累累入。冥王詰責良久，又累累出，各有愧恨之色。[113p]
偶見一吏，似相識而不記姓名，試揖之，亦相答。因問：「此並何人，作此形狀？」吏笑曰：「君亦居幕府，其中豈無一故交耶？」曰：「僕但兩次佐學幕，未入有司署也。」吏曰：「然則真不知矣。此所謂四救先生者也。」問：「四救何義？」曰：「佐幕者有相傳口訣曰：『救生不救死，救官不救民，救大不救小，救舊不救新。[114p]
』救生不救死者，死者已死，斷無可救；生者尚生，又殺以抵命，是多死一人也，故寧委曲以出之，而死者銜冤與否，則非所計也。救官不救民者，上控之案，使冤得申，則官之禍福不可測；使不得申，即反坐，不過軍流耳，而官之枉斷與否，則非所計也。救大不救小者，罪歸上官，則權位重者譴愈重，且牽累必多；罪歸微官，則責任輕者罰可輕，且歸結較易，而小官之當罪與否，則非所計也。救舊不救新者，舊官已去，有所未了，羈留之恐不能償；新官方來，有所委卸，強抑之尚可以辦，其新官之能堪與否，則非所計也。是皆以君子之心，行忠厚長者之事，非有所求取，巧為舞文，亦非有所恩仇，私相報復。[115p]
然人情百態事變萬端，原不能執一而論。苟堅持此例，則矯枉過直，顧此失彼，本造福而反造孽，本弭事而反釀事，亦往往有之。今日所鞫，即以此貽禍者。」問：「其果報何如乎？」曰：「種瓜得瓜，種豆得豆；夙業牽纏，因緣終湊。未來生中，不過亦遇四救先生，列諸四不救而已矣。[116p]
」俯仰之間，霍然忽醒，莫明其入夢之故。豈神明或假告人歟？[117p]
