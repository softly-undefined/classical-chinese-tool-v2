Li Xiya from Jingzhou said that in his family, there was a tenant farmer who was the most courageous. He planted watermelons on the remaining fields, which were located next to a cluster of mounds. When the watermelons were ripe, he would always guard them himself and stay alone in a grass hut. Even if there were occasional strange sounds, he remained calm and unafraid. One night, he heard the chaotic voices of ghosts, as if they were arguing with each other. He went out to see and found two ghosts fighting on a mound, while a female ghost stood in a daze nearby. He asked what was happening, and one of the ghosts said, "Sir, you've come at the right time..."[1p]
"Please, sir, decide the right and wrong of this matter. Is there anyone in the world who would marry his fiancée against her will?" Another person agrees with this statement. The tenant then addresses the female ghost and asks, "Who exactly are you engaged to?" After hesitating for a while, the female ghost replies, "I was originally a prostitute. According to the customs of the brothel, those with a lot of money would secretly arrange marriages. Now that I am in the underworld, I still adhere to the old ways and cannot remember everyone's names one by one."[2p]
"I dare not say who has an appointment, nor do I dare say who does not have an appointment." The tenant laughed and spat, saying, "Where did these two fools come from!" As he looked up, the three ghosts had disappeared. When I was young, I heard my uncle, Chen Gong, speak of a personal encounter. He said, "Among our relatives, there was a deceased individual..."[3p]
The concubine, after changing her mind about getting married, had her soul possessed by a sick servant girl and spoke, saying, "I once asked you and you said you wouldn't marry, why are you being unfaithful now?" The concubine was not afraid and calmly replied, "There are still husbands in the world who have not passed away. Did you expect me to say I would change my mind? Your question was confusing, so it's not surprising that I answered like this." These two incidents can be used to explain each other.

There are scholars who discuss the nonexistence of ghosts, but many difficulties arise.[4p]
He said, "Today is extremely hot. Can I spend the night alone in the cemetery to enjoy some coolness?" The old man determinedly went there, but he found nothing. Upon returning, he felt even more satisfied and said, "Lord Zhu Wen indeed did not deceive me!" I said, "Even if one travels a thousand miles without encountering any thieves, it doesn't mean there are no thieves on the road. Even if one hunts in the wilderness all day without encountering any animals, it doesn't mean there are no animals in the wild. Just because one place has no ghosts, doesn't mean there are no ghosts at all."[5p]
There are no ghosts in the world. By the fact that there are no ghosts appearing in a single night, it can be inferred that there have been no ghosts throughout history. This idea invalidates numerous beliefs. Furthermore, the notion of no ghosts originated from Ruan Zhan, not from Zhu Xi. Zhu Xi specifically asserted that the ascension and descension of souls is a common phenomenon, and it is only the supernatural and strange spirits that deviate from this normality. He did not claim that ghosts do not exist. Therefore, in the Jinqu Qiwulu, it is stated: "The Cheng brothers did not initially deny the existence of gods and spirits, but rather the gods and spirits as defined by the conventions of this world." Yang...[6p]
In the Daoist Record, it is stated: "Rain, wind, dew, thunder, day, night, these are the traces of ghosts and spirits. They are the just and upright spirits of the bright sun. As for those who claim to howl on the beams or touch the chest, they are the so-called unjust, evil, uncertain, unpredictable, or dispersed spirits. Furthermore, there are those who claim that prayers are answered, and wishes are fulfilled. This is also the principle of unity between ghosts and spirits." - Bao Yang[7p]
The record states: "The principles of life and death of ghosts and gods are not as the philosophers of the Shi school or the common folk claim. However, there are clear phenomena that cannot be explained by reason, so it is best not to bother with them." It further states: "Nan Xuan is stubbornly unbelieving. Be it the Yu tripod or the creatures known as Chi Mei and Wang Liang, they indeed exist. They reside in deep mountains and vast marshes. If people approach them, would they not bring about calamity? In Yuzhang..."[8p]
Master Liu, who lived in a hermitage at the top of a mountain, saw a group of lizards entering his hermitage and consuming all the water. Shortly after, hail began piling up outside the hermitage. The next day, the hail descended to the bottom of the mountain. There was a man named Liu Wen, who was married to Master Liu's sister. He was very honest and straightforward, incapable of speaking falsely. He once mentioned that after crossing a hill, he heard the sound of the forest by the creek. There were countless lizards carrying crystal-like objects, and after traveling a few miles, they caused the hail. The reason behind this phenomenon remains unknown.[9p]
。There was once a town where a large Buddha statue made of clay was worshipped by the people. Later, it was decapitated by a disrespectful descendant of a prominent family. The townspeople gathered and mourned, and miraculously, a relic emerged from the neck of the Buddha statue made of clay and wood. This relic is not a natural occurrence, but rather a manifestation of the collective belief and devotion of the people.'

Wu Bi's Records state: 'This story stems from a discussion about Xue Shilong's encounters with ghosts. Those who believe in ghosts and spirits claim that they truly exist in the world. Those who don't believe, firmly deny their existence.[10p]
Many believed that there were no spirits, but there were indeed some who claimed to have truly seen them. Zheng Jingwang, convinced by what the Xue family had witnessed, did not realize that they were merely phenomena like rainbows. He asked, "Are rainbows just gas, or do they have a physical form?" The response was, "Since they can absorb water, they must also have intestines and stomachs. They only disappear after they scatter, similar to the spirits in the realm of thunder." Lin Cilu remarked, "There are many who claim to have seen ghosts in this world, but it is uncertain whether they truly exist or not."[11p]
What? He said, "There are countless things that people in the world see. How can one claim there is none? It's just a matter of not understanding the principles. For example, when someone is being possessed by a spirit, those who are knowledgeable would say it's a matter of different principles. It is because the person's vital energy is not yet completely depleted and they died forcefully, causing their soul to have nowhere to return. Thus, it is like this. In ancient times, there was a person who was traveling at night on the Huai River. They saw numerous figures, resembling humans but not quite, appearing and disappearing between the two waters. This person clearly knew they were ghosts, but was left with no other choice than to charge at them."[12p]
"And passing by. Inquiring about this place, it was once a battlefield where people of the past died unjustly and carried grudges and regrets. Therefore, their spirits have not dispersed. It is said that in the village, there was a man named Li San who died and became a restless ghost. Whenever there were rituals or Buddhist ceremonies in the village, a portion was dedicated to this person. Later, due to fireworks being set off by people, the tree he relied on was burned, and since then he ceased to exist." Said, "He died unjustly, his spirit has not dispersed, and he was bound[13p]
"Explosions startled and scattered them." In the record of Shen Jianlu, it states: "There are people who do not submit to death. So even after their death, their spirit does not dissipate, becoming supernatural and strange. For example, those who die tragically or certain monks and Taoists may not have their spirits dissipated (as they cultivate their spiritual energy to condense and not dissipate)." In the record of Wan Renjie, it states: "When one dies and their spirit disperses, leaving no trace, that is the usual principle. However, in this world, there are exceptions, individuals who may be reborn."[14p]
"There are times when circumstances bring people together by chance, and when they are in close proximity, their emotions can be aroused again." Ye Hesun records: "In a public matter in Tanzhou, a woman killed her husband and buried him secretly. Later, it became haunted, and when the matter was discovered, it no longer haunted. From this, it is known that if such matters in the judicial system are not resolved, the grievances of the deceased will never be relieved." Li Zhuangzu records: "Someone asked, 'Can the resentment of the deceased be resolved if punishment is not imposed?"[15p]
There is a god worshipped in a temple that has been around for hundreds of years. What is the reason for this? It is said that over time, things will naturally come to an end. In the past, when I was stationed in Nankang, there was a long drought and we had no choice but to pray to the gods everywhere. Suddenly, I came across a temple with three dilapidated houses that were in a state of disarray. The people there told me that thirty or fifty years ago, the spirit in that temple was very active and would communicate with people who came to worship. The spirit used to be like that, but now it is like this, it is just the way things change over time.[16p]
『可見』。Yeh Hesun recorded: "Regarding matters of ghosts and gods, it is said that the Guankou Erlang Temple in Shu is dedicated to Li Bing, who built a temple after opening the Li Dui. Nowadays, there are many strange and spiritual phenomena appearing, which are said to be the manifestations of his second son. Initially, this son was given the title of a prince, but later Emperor Huizong developed an interest in Taoism and changed his title to True Lord. Zhang Weigong, when engaging in warfare, prayed at the temple. That night, he dreamt of a divine voice saying, 'I was originally titled a prince[17p]
"In the past, there were offerings of blood given to me, therefore my power and blessings flourished. Now I am revered as a true deity, but people only offer vegetarian food as sacrifices to me, without the nourishment of blood, thus lacking the spiritual power and blessings. Now, it is necessary to reappoint me as a king, so that I may possess divine authority."

Upon hearing this, the Duke of Wei pleaded for the deity to be reinstated as a king. It is unclear whether the Duke of Wei had such a dream or if he came up with this statement during a time of military action. Additionally, there is also a highly spiritual deity in Zitong who seems to have established his own domain.[18p]
The Two Rivers. Generally speaking, when ghosts and gods are offered sacrifices by living beings, it is believed that these spirits reside in the vital energy (qi) of the offerings. This concept is evident in ancient practices such as the manipulation of bronze bells and divination through tortoise shells. Han Qing once said, "Li Tong claimed that when someone shoots a tiger and several people follow it, those who eventually find the dead tiger are actually the ones who were injured by the tiger but their vital energy has not dissipated, thus forming this appearance." Huang Yigang recorded that when discussing the matter of inviting the goddess Zigu to compose poems, it was said, "There are also instances where people invite [the goddess] Zigu to compose poems..."[19p]
When he arrived with a dignified posture, a young lady from his household came to greet him. She didn't know what this was about. In addition, in Quzhou there was a person who dealt with matters and spirits. They would write down the matters on paper and seal them in front of the shrine. After a short while, when the seal was opened, there would be a written response inside the paper. I don't understand how this is possible. All of these stories are compiled and recorded by Li Jingde. So, how could you wrongly accuse Zhu Xi in the end?" This old man asked for the books to examine them.[20p]
After a long while, he sighed and said, "Does Zhu Xi still have this book?" He dispersed with a sense of pity. However, there were still lingering doubts in my mind. The main idea of Zhu Xi is that human beings are born with the qi of heaven and earth, and when they die, their essence disperses back to heaven and earth. As Yeh He and Sun Luqin said, "Just like fish in water, the water outside is the same as the water inside their stomachs. Whether it's the water inside the stomach of a crucian carp or a grass carp, it is fundamentally the same." This reasoning is profound, yet there is none like it.[21p]
The principles of ancestral sacrifices were established by the sages and are recorded in the classics. Consequently, it is necessary for descendants to share a common sentiment and reunite to offer the sacrifices. Once the sacrifices are completed, they disperse into emptiness. However, I am unsure whether this dispersed energy returns and becomes merged with the original energy, or if it remains mixed within the original energy. If they are merged into one, like rivers and streams converging into the sea, becoming one body of water, does it mean that the Yangtze, Huai, Yellow, and Han rivers will no longer gather separately?[22p]
It is impossible for different things to gather in the same place; just like the five flavors mixed in a soup, they all become one flavor, and it is impossible for ginger, salt, vinegar, and soy sauce to gather separately in one place. How can it plow out the breath of a certain person within and connect with their descendants? If it is mixed within the original breath, it will disperse like flying dust, spreading into countless places, like scattered threads flying, with no knowledge of the millions of miles between them. When it comes to the offering of descendants, it is just like stars dotted in the sky.[23p]
, intricately intertwined, yet ultimately forming a whole. Could it be that this is not related to the principles of things? If we examine it from the perspective of its ability to gather, can this energy be considered ignorant? How can it experience and enjoy? If this energy possesses knowledge, how does it come about? Surely there must be a mind, but to what is this mind attached? Surely there must be a body, and once there is a body, it becomes a single entity. Moreover, prior to its gathering, these innumerable tiny particles, thread by thread, are like specks of dust...[24p]
Each has their own knowledge, so there is not just one ghost. However, the ghosts of the Buddhist teachings hide underground, while the ghosts of the Confucian scholars spin in the air. The ghosts of the Buddhist teachings exist regularly, while the ghosts of the Confucian scholars are improvised on the spot. How can one surpass the other? This is truly not something that ordinary scholars know.

In Urumqi, Commander Qian suffered from a cold illness. A Taoist priest came to his door seeking diagnosis and said,[25p]
There is a predestined affinity, so I came to save her. I met a woman named Mrs. Gao, who was quite skilled in medicine. When she saw her prescription, she exclaimed, "Swallowing the Guizhi decoction would suppress the yang energy. It contradicts the disease, how can it be lightly experimented?" I tried to stop her. The Taoist sighed, saying, "It's fate!" and left in a hurry. However, Mrs. Gao used the Chengqi decoction and eventually recovered. She then considered the Taoist to be foolish. After I returned, I accidentally read a collection of official documents, and suddenly...[26p]
A certain individual was discovered to be eroding the village's food supply and committing illegal actions. It is realized that this Taoist priest is not an ordinary person and intends to use medicine to kill him in order to eliminate their leader. This is similar to the previous recorded incident involving an officer in the Ministry of War. Can't we attribute this to their own misdeeds, which cannot be rectified by intelligence alone?

Yao An Gong Yun, it is said, that extraordinary events and phenomena in ordinary households are not good omens. It is mentioned that in the year Gui Si, he visited the home of Mou Zhang Rong (not sure if it refers to Mou Zhang) and witnessed something astonishing.[27p]
In my uncle's house, when I was young and listened to these things, I was not entirely sure. There was a inkstone, naturally shaped like a goose egg, with a deep purple color. It had a phoenix-like eye, as big as a bean, protruding from the center of the inkwell. Its spiral patterns were clear and distinct, and its pupil was bright and lively. When touched, it left a smooth residue on the hand; when knocked, it was as hard as gold and iron; when breathed on, water dripped down like dewdrops. When grinding the ink, it made no sound, and within a few strokes, the ink became thick and dark. It had no[28p]
The inscription on this item reads, "Like the love for its natural perfection, without the desire to carve or chisel." The box itself is made of carved purple sandalwood, with seamless joints and flawless craftsmanship. It is silent when shaken. On the back, there are three small characters, "紫桃軒" (Zi Tao Xuan), as tiny as beans, indicating that it was once owned by Li Taipu Rihua, as mentioned in his collection titled "Zi Tao Xuan Za Zhui." Among all the Song Dynasty inkstones I have seen in my life, this is the finest one. Thus, it is treasured accordingly.[29p]
This inkstone offended the official, and met with an unforeseen calamity, ultimately causing anger and shattering. When disaster is about to strike, one can hear the inkstone groaning in the night.

I was in Urumqi, and the commander of the city guard, Mr. Zhu, presented fresh mushrooms. The commander, Mr. Xu (I happened to forget his name along with Mr. Zhu's. In our daily encounters, we only address each other by our official titles, and rarely inquire about names.), then said, "In the past, before I reached my current position, I once saw a vendor selling fresh mushrooms."[30p]
A person wanted to buy mushrooms. There was an old man nearby who scolded the seller, saying, "He still holds several official positions, how dare you do this?" The seller timidly left. The old man was not acquainted with anyone, and soon no one knew where he went. The next day, it was heard that someone who ate mushrooms in the neighborhood had died. The suspicion arose that the old man was a deity, and the seller was no longer seen afterwards, giving rise to the speculation that he was seeking a replacement through supernatural means. According to "The Annals of Mr. Lü," those who appreciate delicious tastes prefer Yue mushrooms.[31p]
The mushrooms themselves are not poisonous. Their toxicity is caused by snakes and vipers, which, when ingested, cause uncontrollable laughter in humans. Chen Yuren's "Mushroom Records" documents the antidote method of using bitter herbal tea mixed with alum, while Zhang Hua's "Natural History" and Tao Hongjing's "A Collection of Famous Physicians" also document the antidote method of using a solution made from yellow clay and water, known as "ground paste". 

This is an account of the affairs of the family's main hall.[32p]
There is a separate courtyard with a house consisting of three rooms. Whenever a guest stays in this house, they dream of naked men and women chasing and playing, with faces covered in makeup, surrounding them in various seductive poses. At first, the guest finds it enjoyable, but as it continues night after night, they begin to suspect it is a manifestation of an illness of the mind. However, when they move to another room, the dreams cease, leading them to suspect something supernatural. Nevertheless, when they are awake, there is no trace of any influence. Even when they stay awake until dawn with a candle, there is nothing unusual to see or hear. The person also toys with themselves, as if in a frivolous game.[33p]
Unable to see anyone nearby, it seemed as if there were no ghosts, and the situation remained unclear. One day, suddenly I realized that there were more than ten items in the bookshelf, including tooth chisels and stone carvings, as well as various secret scrolls and books of different sizes. It must be these objects that were causing the haunting. So, I secretly informed the host and urged him to burn them all. Someone who knew about the situation said, "How can these objects cause a haunting? They are simply the belongings of the host, who enjoys music and selects courtesans. It is the energy and emotions that attract lascivious spirits to respond."[34p]
This person is also a patron of Qinglou, and his attention is focused on sensual pleasures, allowing him to have alluring dreams. When water stagnates, then mosquitoes breed; when wine sours, then vinegar chickens flock. It is the natural order of things. In the market, there are many vendors selling miscellaneous goods, why not make them all into charms? In the bedroom, there are many people who stay overnight, why not enter their dreams one by one? This is the underlying thought behind it. Merely burning these objects is of no use." Mr. X's decline is evident.[35p]
Huh? Within ten years, the house changed hands.

Ming Gong Shuzhai, once served as the magistrate of Xian County, was an upright and capable official. During his tenure in Taiping Prefecture, there was a suspicious case, so he disguised himself and personally investigated it. He happened to rest in a small cottage and encountered a monk in his eighties. Upon seeing Ming Gong, the monk respectfully stood up and called his disciples to prepare tea. The disciples replied from afar, "The governor is about to arrive, please take the guest to the separate room." The monk replied, "The governor can sit in the main room for now."[36p]
"I have arrived, please come quickly to present yourself." The official was greatly startled and asked, "How do you know that I am coming?" The monk replied, "Sir, as the ruler of this county, every move you make is known throughout the country. How could a humble monk like me not know?" The official then asked, "How do you recognize me?" The monk replied, "If the governor cannot recognize the people of his own county, then who would not recognize the governor?" The official asked further, "Do you know the reason for my visit?" The monk said,[37p]
: "In this case, both parties have sent their subordinates to spread rumors and disinformation for a long time. They all pretend to be ignorant of your righteousness, sir."

Feeling disheartened and lost, the official asked, "Why are you the only one pretending to be ignorant?"

The monk fell to the ground and worshiped, saying, "Deserving of death, deserving of death. I longed for you to ask this question, sir. As the magistrate, you have not fallen short of the likes of Gong and Huang in governing the county. However, there is a subtle dissatisfaction among the people that could be addressed through proper inquiry. These individuals are not just liars and traitors, but also immense threats."[38p]
In deception and manipulation, one should be prepared. Even among the common people in the village, who does not have their own allies and grudges? When investigating the party of person A, they may be straightforward while person B may be crooked. When investigating the party of person B, person A may be crooked while person B may be straightforward. When investigating those who hold grudges, they will inevitably be crooked; when investigating those who have favors, they will inevitably be straightforward. As for women and children, their words may not be true when heard or seen. As for the elderly, they may have confused and unclear speech.[39p]
Can we trust hearsay as evidence? Even when high-ranking officials personally visit, they rely on such information. How could common people have any luck relying on secondhand information? Moreover, seeking information can be harmful, not just in the context of legal disputes. When a village or community is afflicted by a disease, seeking outside help can worsen the situation, especially when it comes to managing rivers and canals. Each individual is concerned with their own well-being. If a water source brings benefits, they will exploit it for their own gain. If there is a problem with the water, neighboring countries will suffer the consequences. This is a winning strategy for them. Who would be willing to consider the larger picture of the geographical terrain?[40p]
"The plan is to create a lasting peaceful and tranquil environment! This old monk, being a recluse, should not involve himself in worldly affairs, let alone matters of the government. However, the teachings of Buddhism emphasize compassion and selfless service to others. If it benefits others, then it is necessary to speak up, even if it means risking one's life. It is up to you, sir, to carefully consider this." The official pondered over these words and ultimately did not pursue the matter any further. The next day, he sent someone to deliver money and grain as requested. Upon his return, the servant reported: "After the official left, the monk said to his disciples:[41p]
"I have completed my heart's matters." Unexpectedly, it has passed away like that. Yang Zhang, from Mianchu, mentioned this matter. Yao Angong said, "In investigating a case, one must examine it with an open mind. Only when the true and false emotions are clear can one trust others and oneself. Trusting others has its disadvantages, as the monks have pointed out. Trusting oneself also has its shortcomings, which are difficult to put into words. How can we find another old monk to explain the teachings again?"[42p]

一處也；如五味和羹，共成一味，不能使薑鹽醯醬各聚一處也。又安能於中犁出某某之氣，使各與子孫相通耶？如參雜於元氣之內，則如飛塵四散，不知析為幾萬億處，如遊絲亂飛，不知相去幾萬億裡。遇子孫享薦，乃星星點點[23p]
，條條縷縷，復合為一。於事理毋乃不近耶？即以能聚而論，此氣如無知，又安能感格？安能歆享？此氣如有知，知於何起？當必有心，心於何附？當必有身，既已有身，則仍一鬼矣。且未聚以前，此億萬微塵，億萬縷縷，塵塵[24p]
縷縷，各有所知，則不止一鬼矣。不過釋氏之鬼，地下潛藏，儒者之鬼，空中旋轉；釋氏之鬼，平日常存，儒家之鬼，臨時湊合耳。又何以相勝耶？此誠非末學所知也。
 
　　烏魯木齊千總某，患寒疾。有道士踵門求診，雲[25p]
有夙緣，特相拯也。會一流人高某婦，頗能醫，見其方，駭曰：「桂枝下嚥，陽盛乃亡，藥病相反，烏可輕試！」力阻之。道士歎息曰：「命也夫！」振衣竟去。然高婦用承氣湯，竟癒。乃以道士為妄。餘歸以後，偶閱邸抄，忽[26p]
見某以侵蝕屯糧伏法，乃悟道士非常人，欲以藥斃之，全其首領也。此與舊所記兵部書吏事相類。豈非孽由自作，非智力所可挽回歟？
 
　　姚安公雲，人家奇器妙跡，終非佳事。因言癸巳同年牟丈瀜家（不知即牟丈，不知[27p]
或牟丈之伯叔，幼年聽之未審也。），有一硯，天然作鵝卵形，色正紫，一鸜鵒眼如豆大，突出墨池中心，旋螺紋理分明，瞳子炯炯有神氣。拊之，膩不留手；叩之，堅如金鐵；呵之，水出如露珠。下墨無聲，數磨即成濃沈。無[28p]
款識銘語，似愛其渾成，不欲椎鑿。匣亦紫檀根所雕，出入無滯，而包裹無纖隙，搖之無聲。背有「紫桃軒」三字，小僅如豆，知為李太僕日華故物也（太僕有說部名《紫桃軒雜綴》。）。平生所見宋硯，此為第一。然後以珍惜[29p]
此硯忤上官，幾罹不測，竟恚而撞碎。禍將作時，夜聞硯若呻吟雲。
 
　　餘在烏魯木齊日，城守營都司朱君饋新菌，守備徐君（與朱均偶忘其名。蓋日相接見，惟以官稱，轉不問其名字耳。）因言：「昔未達時，偶見賣新[30p]
菌者，欲買。一老翁在旁，訶賣者曰：『渠尚有數任官，汝何敢此？』賣者逡巡去。此老翁不相識，旋亦不知其何往。次日，聞裡有食菌死者，疑老翁是社公，賣者後亦不再見，疑為鬼求代也。」《呂氏春秋》稱味之美者，越駱[31p]
之菌，本無毒，其毒皆蛇虺之故，中者使人笑不止。陳玉仁《菌譜》載水調苦茗白礬解毒法，張華《博物志》，陶宏景《名醫別錄》並載地漿解毒法。蓋以此也（以黃泥調水，澄而飲之，曰地漿。）。
 
　　親串家廳事之側[32p]
有別院，屋三楹。一門客，每宿其中則夢見男女裸逐，粉黛雜遝，四圍環繞，備諸媟狀。初甚樂觀，久而夜夜如是，自疑心病也。然移住他室則不夢，又疑為妖。然未睡時，寂無影響；秉燭至旦，亦無見聞。其人亦自相狎戲，如[33p]
不睹旁尚有人，又似非魅，終莫能明。一日，忽悟書廚貯牙鐫石琢橫陳像凡十餘事，秘戲冊卷大小亦十餘事，必此物為祟。乃密白主人盡焚之。有知其事者曰：「是物何能為祟哉！此主人徵歌選妓之所也，氣機所感，而淫鬼應之[34p]
。此君亦青樓之狎客也，精神所注，而妖夢通之。水腐而後蠛蠓生，酒酸而後醯雞集，理之自然也。市肆鬻雜貨者，是物不少，何不一一為祟？宿是室者非一人，何不一一入夢哉？此可思其本矣。徒焚此物，無益也。」某氏其衰[35p]
乎？不十年，而屋易主。
 
　　明公恕齋，嘗為獻縣令，良吏也。官太平府時，有疑獄，易服自察訪之。偶憩小庵，僧年八十餘矣，見公合掌肅立，呼其徒具茶。徒遙應曰：「太守且至，可引客權坐別室。」僧應曰：「太守[36p]
已至，可速來獻。」公大駭曰：「爾何以知我來？」曰：「公，一郡之主也，一舉一動，通國皆知之，寧獨老僧？」又問：「爾何以識我？」曰：「太守不能識一郡之人，一郡之人，則孰不識太守？」問：「爾知我何事出？」曰[37p]
：「某案之事，兩造皆遣其黨，布散道路間久矣。彼皆陽不識公耳。」公憮然自失，因問：「爾何獨不陽不識？」僧投地膜拜曰：「死罪，死罪。欲得公此問也。公為郡不減龔、黃，然微不慊於眾心者，曰好訪。此不特神奸巨蠹[38p]
，能預為蠱惑計也；即鄉裡小民，孰無親黨，孰無恩怨乎哉？訪甲之黨，則甲直而乙曲；訪乙之黨，則甲曲而乙直。訪其有仇者，則有仇者必曲；訪其有恩者，則有恩者必直。至於婦人孺子，聞見不真；病媼衰翁，語言昏憒，又[39p]
可據為信讞乎？公親訪猶如此，再寄耳目於他人，庸有幸乎？且夫訪之為害，非僅聽訟為然也。閭閻利病，訪亦為害，而河渠堤堰為尤甚。小民各私其身家，水有利則遏以自肥，水有患則鄰國為壑，是其勝算矣。孰肯揆地形之大[40p]
局，為永遠安瀾之計哉！老僧方外人也，本不應預世間事，況官家事耶？第佛法慈悲，捨身濟眾，苟利於物，固應冒死言之耳。惟公俯察焉。」公沈思其語，竟不訪而歸。次日，遣役送錢米。歸報曰：「公返之後，僧謂其徒曰：[41p]
『吾心事已畢。』竟泊然逝矣。」此事楊丈汶川嘗言之。姚安公曰：「凡獄情虛心研察，情偽乃明，信人信己皆非也。信人之弊，僧言是也；信己之弊，亦有不可勝言者。安得再一老僧，亦為說法乎！」
