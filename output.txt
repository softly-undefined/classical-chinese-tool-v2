If you want to fight and devour, recognize the father's language and voice of his son; crouch and tremble, nearly losing all color. All the guests are trembling, hiding and fleeing, some stumbling and falling, breaking their foreheads. Everyone present cannot help but sigh. This incident occurred in the year Jiayin during the reign of Emperor Yongzheng. Shilu witnessed it with his own eyes, but refused to reveal the person's name. The late master, the diligent Awen Gong, said, "If a family does not understand hospitality, then the younger generation will not respect the nobles. Only the old woman is seen.[1p]
"Servants and slaves, what good are they? If one's household has too many guests, there will inevitably be wicked and false friends mixed among them, engaging in inappropriate and harmful relationships, causing endless harm to one's descendants. Over the past several decades, through personal experience and observation, I have come to understand that your words are genuine and valuable medicine."

King Sais of the Five Armies once said that there was a farmer who guarded his jujube orchard at night and saw what seemed to be a figure outside the orchard. Suspecting a thief, he secretly observed. Soon, a person [2p]...[2p]
A person from the east came and asked, "What brings you to this place?" The man replied, "When I was buried, someone nearby secretly placed a lucky charm on me, and I have been carrying it with me for over twenty years. And now that person is also deceased, so I am waiting here for them to pass by as well." How deep is the resentment and malice in this person!

There was a grudge between person A and person B, which person A's wife was unaware of. When person A passed away, his wife decided to remarry, and person B generously paid a large sum of money to marry her. Three mornings later, [3p].[3p]
Translate the following Classical Chinese text to English: 'Together we went to visit my elder brother and his wife. On the way back, we took a detour to Jia's tomb. I approached the farmers and laborers, tapping my wife's shoulder and calling out, "Do you recognize this woman?" My wife was angry and wanted to touch a tree. The crowd immediately pulled her back, but suddenly a gust of wind came, obscuring our vision with dust and sand. Both husband and wife seemed to have lost their souls. When they were finally brought back, they experienced alternating periods of confusion and wakefulness, and their condition never improved. The old servant Zhang Cai from my wife's maternal family was deeply concerned and personally witnessed this scene.'[4p]
Upon seeing it, it is known that although repaying enmity with kindness is not prohibited by the sages, they will not do so if it exceeds a certain limit. In the Suwen, it is stated: "Excessiveness will lead to harm." In the Jiayu, it is said: "Excessiveness will result in ruination." When one's action is excessively aggressive or excessively complacent, it is only natural that there will be consequences.

Regarding the recitation of the Flame Mouth Sutra by the monk, although the language used is somewhat colloquial, when hearing the mantras for summoning spirits and offering food to them, it is indeed in accordance with the teachings of Buddhism. As for the remainder in Ulu...[5p]
"Mu Qi, once I discussed this matter with a friend, and there were disagreements. The official servant of the printing room, a slave named Bai Liu, who had been sent to guard against thieves, abruptly said: 'This is not a false claim. I encountered a rich family whose mansion was set on fire, and I wanted to take advantage of the chaos to steal something, but there was no opportunity for me to exploit. I hid on the corner of a high building, overlooking the shaking of bells and the recitation of spells. I saw countless black shadows, about two or three feet tall, crossing over the walls or entering through windows."[6p]
"Upon entering, there is a constant ebb and flow, and everywhere that is uninhabited is filled. When it is time to disperse, they quickly gather and scatter, moving swiftly back and forth, like a chaotic dance, reaching up and bending down, as if searching for something. Their appearance is like light smoke, and their shape vaguely resembles that of a person, but their facial features and limbs cannot be distinguished."

"Yet, these spirits still seek sustenance. Is it not unbelievable?" 

This text is from the work "Poems by the Dunhuang Prefect of Later Han, Pei Cen".[7p]
"The Monument of King Huyan" is located in the Guandi Temple on the Haizi River in Barkun. It was discovered while conducting military farming and reclamation work in the area. Its content is not found in the "Book of Later Han," but its language is ancient and obscure, its characters and strokes are simple and unadorned, and it is clearly not something later generations relied on. Being in a remote place in the Western Regions, it was not copied or imitated by anyone, and the stone carving is still intact with sharp edges. In the Gengyin year of the Qianlong period (in the Qing dynasty), the guerrilla Liu Cunren visited (I have forgotten his real name but this is his style name). [8p][8p]
The text is in Classical Chinese, which is a highly poetic and archaic form of the Chinese language. Here is the translated text:

"He was a person from Wujin. He imitated and carved a wood piece, sprinkling gunpowder on top, burning it to create mottled patterns, resembling ancient stone tablets. These two imitations were widely circulated in the world, and connoisseurs often mistook the old stone imitation for a new one, and the new wood imitation for an old one. When confronted with this, they arrogantly refused to believe it. If even contemporaneous things witnessed by people can be so easily confused, how much more uncertain would things be from thousands of years ago! In the symbols and numbers of the Book of Changes (Yi Jing), and in the poetry..."[9p]
"Preface to the Xiaoxu: In the three commentaries of the Spring and Autumn Annals, some have personally witnessed the sage, while others have learned from those who were not far removed from ancient times. The transmission of knowledge is clear and understandable, as the masters have taught and passed down. The scholars of the Song dynasty said, 'People before the Han dynasty did not know, but I know it through reason.' This is similar to such cases.

In the fourteenth year of the Kangxi reign, a lion from the Western Regions was presented as tribute, and many predecessors in the court wrote poems about it. It is rumored that it soon escaped, its departure being as quick as the wind."[10p]
"At the eighth hour, the lock is carved. At noon, immediately leave Jiaoyuguan. This is the language of Qi Dong. When the Holy Ancestor toured the south, he returned to Luoyang via the Wei River and carried this lion on the ship. My great-grandmother, Lady Cao, once peered through the crack in the window of the Dufan Tower and saw it. Its body is like a yellow dog, its tail is like a tiger but slightly longer, and its face is round like a human, unlike other animals that are slender. It is tied to the general's pillar at the bow of the ship, with a pig bound to feed it. The pig on the shore still cries out."[11p]
"Upon calling, the closer the ship, the more silent it becomes. When the lion is placed in front, it lowers its head and sniffs once, already terrified to death. As we were about to untie the ropes, suddenly there was a roaring sound like countless copper bells abruptly striking together. In the stables of my maternal grandfather's house, there were more than ten horses; when they heard it from behind the fence, they all trembled and cowered under the manger. Even when the boat was about to move, they still dared not move. We believed it to be the king of all beasts. When the lion had just arrived, the Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Rites, A Gongli, drew..."[12p]
The text mentions Gu and Lu, who were contemporary figures. Zeng Tuo, a skilled painter, once used a writing brush to create a painting, which was exquisitely crafted. The painting was originally kept in the home of a respected senior of the Bo Xizhai family, who had received it as a gift from their grandfather. Later, it was sold to me and I once begged for a written inscription from a knowledgeable connoisseur. The grandfather had initially not signed the painting, but because there were records of lions being offered during the Yuan Dynasty, it was given the title "The True Form of a Lion by a Yuan Dynasty Artist." Xizhai remarked, "The talent of the current generation surpasses that of the Yuan Dynasty. This painting is a reward."[13p][13p]
"Reflecting upon the past, it is not an error."[14p]
